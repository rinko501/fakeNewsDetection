       " '138k shares share this story  s trumps number one backer in silicon valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination the us department of labor filed suit charging that palantir technologies the palo alto technology company controlled by republican businessman peter thiel accusing him of systematically discriminating against asian job applicants in the companys hiring process palantir is a federal government contractor to the nsa  sources say that donald trump wants to deliver a lifetime supreme court nomination to thiel who despises the first amendments protections antitrust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy both the stanford law school grad thiel and trumps campaign later denied the report vanity fair noted that  according to the lawsuit palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions 73 percent of those who applied were asian ultimately the lawsuit says the company hired four asians and 17 nonasians the likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion the lawsuit says  ironically peter thiel the trump donor who bloomberg called the republican nominees most unlikely supporter is himself a first generation immigrant thiels parents came to america to find work in a high tech field but now hes supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether  thiel was a paypal cofounder and early facebook investor but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year the billionaire revealed himself in march to be hulk hogans secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted gawker in retaliation for revealing the billionaires thensecret sexual orientation  but now the entire world knows mr thiel prefers male company after he delivered a very personal political address at the republican national convention in cleveland thiel then called out the gops bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said every american has a unique identity im proud to be gay im proud to be a republican after a lengthy rant against government incompetence he became the first ever openly gay speaker at the rnc to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais and only the second speaker to be openly gay period  unfortunately his own party didnt pay much attention to the speech which was surprisingly well received inside the hall as you can see below because they passed the most antilgbt platform in party history this year which speaks volumes when you consider that the bush administration used antimarriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s  federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination said the department of labors ofccp director patricia shiu our nations taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers lisa gordon a spokeswoman for palantir said the company will defend itself vigorously and denies allegations of bias in a statement to bloomberg news  now the executive who accused his employer  the federal government  of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his companys hiring practices were competent in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump\\n': {'according^all',\n",

       " 'jim carrey claims donald trump is a reptilianilluminati blood prince  jim carrey has told fans and supporters that donald trump is not human but is a reptilian that shapeshifts between human and reptile form and he has witnessed the president shapeshift in the flesh before my very eyes and in my opinion as personal warning to me  speaking to supporters at the signature gallery in las vegas where he is hosting his first ever art exhibition sunshower the beloved comedic actor dropped hints about the themes buried deep in his paintings  i am interested in what is behind the veil of reality the real power structures that control the universe im no longer interested in the daily facade ive put everything i know into these paintings  carrey first met donald trump at a boxing match held at the trump hotel  casino in atlantic city in the early 90s a popular tv actor at the time carrey was criticized by trumps associates for failing to entertain the future president  but according to carrey he was avoiding him like the plague because he witnessed trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue  donald trump has a long reptile face an oversized beak and his scales are a disgusting grey color like sewer water carrey said  explaining that donald trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form at least three times while greeting him carrey claims that he also saw trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests  his hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable when he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewelencrusted daggers  it wasnt just me im not going to name names but these secrets are well known in certain circles among those in the know  carrey says he believes trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilianpolitical illuminati of which he is a blood prince  this branch of the illuminati the most powerful branch they come from bavaria carrey said explaining that bavaria is trumps ancestral homeland  asked if he had proof of his claims carrey told his supporters to watch what happens when these issues get raised in the media the gatekeepers will try to deny i said these things when that doesnt work they will try and destroy my reputation  carrey also told his fans and supporters to look deeply at his artworks to decipher their real meaning  there are some things you cant say but you can paint i have put everything i know into those paintings  its 1am im eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends ive never felt more at peace carrey said  carreys first hand experiences with the reptilianilluminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts  i have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive tyrannical powers that rule our world travelling to over 80 countries and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing people briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes  ive been told this by californian news anchors ethiopian goatherds and australian aboriginals just to name a few  a danish taxi driver described driving past a group of vip guests at the 2014 bilderberg meeting in copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look  in peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power like obama david cameron and hillary clinton turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel  the worlds ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media as well as our food water and air supply and they are actively dumbing down the masses  the evidence against them ancient and modern is enormous and continuing to grow\\n': {'2014^all',\n",
