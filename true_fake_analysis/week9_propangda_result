Geneva - The World Health Organisation chief on Wednesday said a deadly plague epidemic appeared to have been brought under control in Madagascar, but warned the next outbreak would likely be stronger. :world^all	control^technical	wednesday^all	control^all	next^persuasive	brought^all	said^all	world^persuasive	health^persuasive	health^all
"The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, insisting that "the issue is serious." :could^all	next^persuasive	could^persuasive	told^all	could^subjectivity

He also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak. :also^persuasive	also^all
He praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over. :helped^all
This along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that "when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw," Tedros said. :poor^persuasive	control^technical	could^all	poor^subjectivity	control^all	next^persuasive	could^persuasive	higher^all	poor^sentiment	comes^all	could^subjectivity

A religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him. :regarding^persuasive	many^all	poverty^sentiment	political^all	poverty^subjectivity	state^technical	state^all	poverty^technical

Now that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump’s decision a "reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology" and to accuse the Trump administration of “lying to the American people.” It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal. :left^all	trump^all	facts^all	ahead^all	president^all	trying^subjectivity	obama^all	facts^subjectivity	trying^all	american^all	trump^subjectivity

John Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called “strategic patience.” The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea’s nuclear program at its inception. :use^technical	north^all	decided^all	years^all	use^all	president^all	bill^all	force^subjectivity	clearly^all	states^all	korea^all	deal^subjectivity	nuclear^all	learned^all	clearly^sentiment	learned^technical	force^persuasive	use^persuasive	learned^subjectivity	deal^all	clearly^subjectivity	obviously^subjectivity	force^all	nothing^all	obviously^persuasive

For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality. :first^persuasive	trump^all	obama^all	may^all	time^all	trump^subjectivity	first^all
Starting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did. :war^subjectivity	trump^all	war^sentiment	greater^sentiment	war^all	america^all	trump^subjectivity
By merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran. :trump^all	trump^subjectivity
Trump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies. :trump^all	control^technical	large^all	control^all	large^subjectivity	trump^subjectivity
Before Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord. :trump^all	first^persuasive	interests^subjectivity	whether^all	nuclear^all	trump^subjectivity	interests^all	first^all	security^all	interests^sentiment	security^subjectivity
By placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions. :trump^all	free^sentiment	free^persuasive	free^subjectivity	deal^all	free^all	deal^subjectivity	nuclear^all	trump^subjectivity
Only then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies. :announce^all	full^subjectivity	full^persuasive	interests^subjectivity	announce^persuasive	nuclear^all	full^all	interests^all	interests^sentiment

Last July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, warned that “putting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.” IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that "if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world." :state^all	terrorist^all	general^technical	october^all	islamic^all	guards^persuasive	correct^subjectivity	correct^all	terrorist^persuasive	terrorist^sentiment	general^persuasive	general^all	american^all	staff^all	said^all	state^technical	groups^all	states^all
With the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran’s leaders to further finance the IRGC’s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran’s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal. :trump^all	even^all	financial^all	furious^sentiment	making^all	furious^persuasive	nuclear^all	trump^subjectivity	even^subjectivity	furious^subjectivity

Bagheri is quoted as saying that his visit’s purpose was to “put a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.” Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri’s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria. :terrorist^all	believe^subjectivity	syria^all	experts^all	terrorist^persuasive	terrorist^sentiment	believe^all	time^all	believe^persuasive

Proponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration’s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles. :trump^all	kill^persuasive	crisis^subjectivity	deal^all	continued^technical	caused^all	crisis^persuasive	north^all	kill^sentiment	deal^subjectivity	crisis^all	nuclear^all	trump^subjectivity	crisis^sentiment	kill^subjectivity	continued^all	korea^all

However, the White House has decided to comply, which I wonder just how dangerous a precedent this sets, and as a result, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has issued a code of conduct for the White House press. :conduct^technical	issued^all	house^all	decided^all	press^subjectivity	white^subjectivity	press^all	white^all
The fact that the White House submitted to such a ridiculous demand when it is simple human decency to conduct one's self in a proper manner, unlike how Jim Acosta treated both Sarah Sanders, President Donald Trump and a White House aide, is a testimony to how little those who represent us know of our Constitution. :trump^all	fact^subjectivity	conduct^technical	president^all	house^all	fact^all	ridiculous^sentiment	human^technical	human^all	trump^subjectivity	ridiculous^subjectivity	white^subjectivity	ridiculous^persuasive	white^all
“At this time, however, we have decided not to frame such rules in the hope that professional journalistic norms will suffice to regulate conduct in those places,” Sanders said. :decided^all	conduct^technical

Defeated Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams finally ended her challenges on Friday and ended her challenges against Republican opponent Brian Kemp. :georgia^all	candidate^all	brian^all	republican^all

Notice how quickly the drive-by media and self-proclaimed "fact checkers" gunned down the Trump administration and Infowars with their lying propaganda over the video that was enhanced, not doctored, to demonstrate that all of them and Jim Acosta are lying through their Communist teeth? :trump^all	media^all	lying^persuasive	lying^subjectivity	video^all	trump^subjectivity

CNN's Jim Acosta told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he *never* touched the female White House aide that tried to take the mic away from him. :away^all	house^all	told^all	white^subjectivity	female^technical	white^all
But it's more than that, self-proclaimed "fact checkers" like Snopes simply posted an Associated Press article, which clearly biased towards indicating the video was "doctored" by saying it was sped up, but that's not doctoring. :simply^all	simply^subjectivity	snopes^all	clearly^subjectivity	press^subjectivity	video^all	clearly^sentiment	clearly^all	press^all

I'm sure NewsGuard, Yemile Bucay, Anna-Sophie Harling and Amy Westfeldt need to update this in the light of the obvious lies and editing of the Acosta video and decades of documented, outright lies and propaganda by the Clown News Network, but you can't expect real transparency from an outlet like Newsguard whose writers aren't transparent about their own political bias, can you? :obvious^persuasive	sure^subjectivity	sure^persuasive	real^all	light^persuasive	need^subjectivity	obvious^all	real^subjectivity	sure^all	political^all	video^all	need^all	obvious^subjectivity	need^technical	light^all	light^subjectivity

WASHINGTON – A federal judge on Friday ordered the White House to restore CNN reporter Jim Acosta’s press badge, which had been revoked earlier this month after a contentious exchange at a news conference with President Donald Trump. :conference^all	judge^all	federal^all	earlier^all	president^all	house^all	ordered^technical	press^subjectivity	reporter^all	white^subjectivity	white^all	press^all

Many were surprised to discover that Fox News not only is supporting lying CNN and lying Jim Acosta, but they are even going so far as to file an amicus brief with the US district court over the White House's revoking of Acosta's press pass. :even^all	many^all	district^all	lying^persuasive	lying^subjectivity	press^subjectivity	fox^all	white^subjectivity	even^subjectivity	white^all	press^all
This is a privilege issue and it seems that Acosta wore out his welcome with his attacks on Sarah Sanders, being belligerent during his time asking a question(s) of President Donald Trump, and his pushing aside a White House aide who simply tried to remove the microphone from him. :welcome^sentiment	simply^all	seems^all	welcome^subjectivity	president^all	simply^subjectivity	house^all	time^all	white^subjectivity	white^all
