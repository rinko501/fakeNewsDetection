=======================
1. Introduction

This project is a project used for fake news and propaganda news detection. We choose the dictionary as our features. Meanwhile, we also do news language analysis.

=======================
2. Dataset

In the folder "dataset_a" is the 5 fake news datasets we collected. These datasets are used for building our feature dictionaries and also for the fake news classification.


=======================
3. Dictionary

In the folder "other_dict" is the dictionaries we use for the second comparison. And there are 3 folders, and they are the propaganda datasets for generating the "Propaganda Lexicon" and propaganda news classification.



=======================
3. Machine Learning

The machine learning part is in the "true_fake_analysis" folder. We did the classifications with different features in this part. In this folder, we build our lexicons, and we put them in the "result_fake_true(_xxx)" folders. Now we mainly use the version of "result_fake_true_after_reduce_stopwords". And the other ".ipynb" files are our experiment codes. We already label each one a specific name about what it is.



=======================
5. NELA

In this folder, we attach the code of the NELA project(https://github.com/BenjaminDHorne/The-NELA-Toolkit). To generate the NELA features for our data, we need to change the path in "runfile.py" and run the file.
