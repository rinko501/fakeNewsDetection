kellyanne conway praised donald trump for showing restraint at the debate  ap photo trump camp donald trump is guilty of answering the question asked  donald trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of monday nights debate when hillary clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women  i have to say certainly as a woman i appreciated the restraint at the end i am not sure i would have been able to exercise it myself but restraint is a virtue and its a presidential virtue conway told msnbcs morning joe tuesday to tell hillary clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women to tell hillary clinton i was prepared to go rough tonight and i am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here that is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint  story continued below  with just minutes left in monday nights debate clinton managed to work in a line of attack against trump that she has also used mostrecently in a new campaign ad hitting the manhattan billionaire as a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs after the debate trump told cnn that i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary to her family and i said to myself i cant do it indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with clintons husband and daughter in the audience  tuesday morning conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly trumps attack might have been  i think he could have said what was on millions of americans minds no doubt that are we going to relitigate whos been good to women and who hasnt conway said theyre taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen versus where he could have gone and i think we all can finish the sentence people did last night they finished the sentence they said you know maybe he was going to talk about bill clintons record with women but he decided not to  overall conway said clinton failed to deliver a knockout punch that would have forced trump into a major error instead trumps campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator lester holt  donald trump is guilty of answering the question asked and i thought hillary clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks and thats fine conway said  i dont think hillary clinton did a thing last night if somebody can correct me what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation she added so i didnt hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of americans who want change who want a different direction that shes their gal  authors

i would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter sen mitch mcconnell said  getty mcconnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell delayed a procedural vote on a mustpass government spending measure monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill even with a monthslong impasse over zika funding largely resolved  the key vote is now scheduled for 215 pm tuesday mcconnell said  giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until dec 9 for now however sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the zika virus while allowing planned parenthoods partner clinic in puerto rico to access the federal grants  a provision that had been a major point of contention  story continued below  senate republicans stand ready to move forward mcconnell rky said monday i would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter  mcconnell spent about five minutes huddling with senate minority leader harry reid dnev on monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the senate to recess as soon as the end of the week  but the tentative resolution on zika funding sets aside for now one of the toughest sticking points in the shortterm spending measure senate democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone zika bill over restrictions that barred planned parenthood  particularly profamilias the health care providers partner in puerto rico  from the federal funds but in the cr the puerto rico clinic would have access to the money which would come through a 95 million social services block grant in a broader 11 billion zika package multiple sources said  language in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding skirting a political landmine thats delayed zika aid for months  despite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquitoborne disease several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations in a brief interview monday morning reid said no when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day  close is relative reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach  for instance funding for the water crisis in flint michigan continues to be in the mix democrats on both ends of the capitol have lobbied for flint funds to be included in the government spending package in particular the aid package included in a senate water resources bill  but republicans have similar demands additional funding for floodstricken louisiana in the shortterm spending measure both issues remained unresolved as of monday evening although senior senate democrats suggested they wouldnt accept flood aid without also getting money for flint congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the zika funding package  louisiana is not resolved because republicans want to do louisiana we want to do flint sen chuck schumer dny told reporters monday evening they dont want to do flint  another issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the obama administrations proposal to hand over the us governments authority over the internet domain system to an international body on oct 1  a push thats being led by texas sen ted cruz and a host of other republican lawmakers if no deference is paid to cruz and those lawmakers the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among republicans  even with some pushback on the provision from democrats  this is the coordination of the domain names its not who has control of the internet florida sen bill nelson the top democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue said monday and every institution nationally and internationally have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do  meanwhile democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the exportimport bank to finance projects greater than 10 million  which it hasnt been able to do because three of the five seats on the banks board are vacant the exim issue is similarly toxic among republicans making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election  there are other items that could fill up the senates legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the november elections sens chris murphy dconn and rand paul rky plan to force a senate vote to block a 115 billion arms sale to saudi arabia that the obama administration announced last month  senate majority whip john cornyn rtexas said the exact timing of that vote was unclear particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by president barack obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the sept 11 2001 terrorism attacks to sue the government of saudi arabia  though obama has not yet vetoed the measure he has until friday to do so  republicans  who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection particularly with control of the senate in the balance  privately believe democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the sept 30 deadline to pass government funding      heather caygle contributed to this report  authors

washington since we last updated the cnn battleground map donald trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states the republican nominee has also upped his game as have his allied outside group friends with television ad spending  and yet hillary clinton maintains her advantage on the road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency  with four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast hillary clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest cnn outlook when you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning clintons way she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate    hear cnn political director david chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast  whats changed   iowa 6 moves from from battleground to lean republican   utah 6 moves from lean republican to solid republican   maines 2nd congressional district 1 moves from solid democrat to battleground   nebraskas 2nd congressional district 1 moves from solid republican to battleground  road to 270 electoral college map  note the split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines  the state of play  donald trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to iowa a state barack obama won twice and its six electoral votes moving from the true tossup battleground category into the lean republican category giving trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor  that leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states plus two congressional districts  florida nevada ohio and north carolina  maine and nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results both maine and nebraskas second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate maines second congressional district has moved from solid democrat to battleground and nebraskas second congressional district has moved from solid republican to battleground providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory  finally utah moves back from leaning republican to being solidly being in trumps column  there is no doubt that trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states but clintons firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes trumps path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging  for all of the endless talk about florida ohio and north carolina it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on clintons performance in the states that are leaning her way but not solidly in her camp pennsylvania colorado michigan and virginia are the core of clintons current stronger and more viable path to 270 if trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blueleaning states that will set off some alarm bells at her brooklyn hq and suggest a more viable path for trump  it is not enough for trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states  that only gets him to 266 he still needs to chip away at clintons democratic leaning firewall  thats why we see both trump and clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to pennsylvania for example and thats why clinton and proclinton forces spent more than 16 million on television ads in the keystone state compared to the 53 million weve seen from trump and protrump forces in fact pennsylvania is the state with the thirdhighest number of ad dollars spent this cycle behind only florida and ohio  clinton and trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of floridians and ohioans but until and unless trump can put one of those democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way clintons electoral college advantage holds  solid republican  alabama 9 alaska 3 arkansas 6 idaho 4 indiana 11 kansas 6 kentucky 8 louisiana 8 mississippi 6 missouri 10 montana 3 nebraska 4 north dakota 3 oklahoma 7 south carolina 9 south dakota 3 tennessee 11 texas 38 utah 6west virginia 5 wyoming 3 163 total  leans republican  arizona 11 georgia 16 iowa 6 33 total  battleground states  florida 29 nevada 6 ohio 18 maine 2nd congressional district 1 nebraska 2nd congressional district 1 north carolina 15 70 total  leans democratic  colorado 9 michigan 16 new hampshire 4 pennsylvania 20 virginia 13 wisconsin 10 72 total  solid democratic  california 55 connecticut 7 delaware 3 dc 3 hawaii 4 illinois 20 maine 3 maryland 10 massachusetts 11 new jersey 14 new york 29 oregon 7 rhode island 4 vermont 3 washington 12 minnesota 10 new mexico 5 200 total

on saturday september 17 at 830 pm est an explosion rocked west 23 street in manhattan in the neighborhood commonly referred to as chelsea injuring 29 people smashing windows and initiating street closures there were no fatalities officials maintain that a homemade bomb which had been placed in a dumpster created the explosion the explosive device was removed by the police at 225 am and was sent to a lab in quantico virginia for analysis a second device which has been described as a pressure cooker device similar to the device used for the boston marathon bombing in 2013 was found on west 27th street between the avenues of the americas and seventh avenue by sunday morning all 29 people had been released from the hospital the chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident saturday morning in seaside heights new jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5k marine corps charity race there were no casualties by sunday afternoon law enforcement had learned that the ny and nj explosives were traced to the same person  given that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent when a bomb goes off our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism after all in the last year alone we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in paris san bernardino california orlando florida and nice to name a few and of course last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the september 11 2001 attacks where close to 3000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists however we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards selfpreservation which of course includes identifying the evildoers isnt that how crimes are solved law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the bad guys unfortunately our leadership  who ostensibly wants to protect us  finds their hands and their tongues tied they are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone  new york city mayor bill de blasio  who famously ended stopandfrisk profiling in his city  was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the chelsea neighborhood explosion there is no specific and credible threat to new york city from any terror organization de blasio said late saturday at the news conference we believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act i want to assure all new yorkers that the nypd and  agencies are at full alert he said isnt an intentional act terrorism we may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as isis or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals it is still terrorism it is not an accident james oneill the new york city police commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the mayor made his comments new yorks governor andrew cuomo was a little more direct than de blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility however he did say that it is a question of how the word terrorism is defined a bomb exploding in new york is obviously an act of terrorism cuomo hit the nail on the head but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his obvious assessment  the two candidates for president hillary clinton and donald trump also weighed in on the chelsea explosion clinton was very generic in her response saying that we need to do everything we can to support our first responders  also to pray for the victims and that we need to let this investigation unfold trump was more direct i must tell you that just before i got off the plane a bomb went off in new york and nobody knows whats going on he said but boy we are living in a timewe better get very tough folks we better get very very tough its a terrible thing thats going on in our world in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant  unfortunately an incident like the chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as soft targets now more than ever america needs strong leadership which is laserfocused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

posted by frank wilkenmeyer on 19 sep 2016  donald trump jr is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media in the very least its a tossup between him and little brother eric who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish selfadmiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question along with free wifi pushup bras and bozo the clown  together the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare when this election is finally over it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion maybe well keep track of their twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then  todays silliness begins with oompa loompa jr pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now colin kaepernick and the national anthem as more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support black lives matter more and more conservatives trash them for it calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage lord cheeto ii has been one of the most vocal accusing kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom  for the left its a simple matter of the 1st amendment regardless of how you feel about the issue these athletes have the right to express themselves yes that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism but lets not forget that its people like little combover who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason  for years weve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second so when this tweet appeared pinned to mini douches twitter account this morning i couldnt help but bust out in hysterical laughter  clearly when youre the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use when liberals  otherwise known as sane people  try to explain why people like kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right were attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism its not the first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789 the right to be you  the supreme court has sided with those liberals every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer ive said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and ill say it again the 2nd amendment is the only one they see as absolute all others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like donald trump jr  featured image by gage skidmore

the recent connected bombings in new york and new jersey and the stabbing attack at a mall in minnesota have increased interest in how the presidential candidates would handle national security  hillary clinton and donald trump have spoken out since the attacks which left dozens of people injured  john cohen a former counterterrorism coordinator for the department of homeland security said he believes that the terrorist attacks that have occurred during the campaign have a significant impact on voters  when events occur like this  you tend to have people become more fearful and when people are more fearful they tend to gravitate towards a candidate who appears to be more strong said cohen who currently works as an abc news consultant  three of the latest national polls  all conducted before the attacks this weekend  had clinton leading when respondents were asked whom they trust to handle the issue of terrorism  in an abc newswashington post poll released sept 11 clinton led 50 percent to trumps 41 percent among all adults and 48 percent to trumps 45 percent among likely voters when asked about who was more trusted to handle terrorism  a cbsnew york times poll released sept 14 had clinton doing a better job handling terrorism and national security according to 49 percent of respondents compared with trumps 45 percent  the split was closest in a quinnipiac poll released sept 15 in which respondents were asked who they thought would do a better job keeping the country safe from terrorism regardless of how you intend to vote in that poll clinton got 49 percent to trumps 47 percent  traditionally its been the republican party who has projected strength and awareness in the area of law enforcement and homeland security but today thats kind of flipped because despite his rhetoric there are a number of national security experts who have raised concerns about the level of understanding that donald trump has as it relates to terrorism and national security threats cohen said  andres kudackiap photo  current events are factoring into the political campaigns with the candidates scheduling speeches about national security in the wake of attacks but cohen said political rhetoric could also be affecting and even motivating the attacks themselves  he said trumps rhetoric and calls to bar foreign muslims from entering the united states may even serve to further along those who are becoming inspired to act on isis behalf  james campbell a professor of political science at the university at buffalo in new york who has written a book about political polarization told abc news that he believes the attacks translate to a potential advantage for trump  i have to think that terrorist events in this country help trump and hurt clinton for these events to be occurring with the frequency they do may be read by many as a failure of the current administration and particularly its foreign policy team to effectively deal with the problem he said  it may also suggest that we need a tougher approach to dealing with terrorism an approach associated with trump when suspects are identified who have muslimsounding names then that may further fuel support for tougher immigration standards and scrutiny campbell added

monday night was the mostwatched debate in american history  well over 80 million people tuned in to see hillary clinton and donald trump face off setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates  according to nielsen the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the tv channels that carried it live  many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web  nielsens 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional tv channels at home people who watched the debate at parties bars restaurants and offices were not counted neither were cspan viewers  this means the actual total audience is even higher  on the tv side cnn and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years so did the broadcast networks  nbc had the biggest audience overall partly because nbc nightly news anchor lester holt was the moderator of the debate upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on nbc  abc drew 135 million viewers cbs drew 121 million fox news drew 114 million cnn drew 99 million the fox broadcast network drew 55 million and msnbc drew 49 million  the debate was also a hit on spanish language television attracting 25 million viewers on univision and 18 million on telemundo  trump may have been the ratings magnet but clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump by tuesday there was a media consensus that clinton had prevailed in the debate  the debate viewership number to beat was 806 million set back in 1980 when jimmy carter and ronald reagan debated just once before the election  more recently the first obamaromney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers  detailed nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time contrary to some speculation there was not a big dropoff after the first 30 minutes of the 98minute debate  the vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end a fact that the clinton campaign celebrated on tuesday  earlier story ratings expectations for first trumpclinton debate are sky high  anticipation for the clintontrump meeting had been mounting for months television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million  there will be two more debates between the candidates in october  on monday night twitter said the first faceoff was the most tweeted debate ever  given the rapid growth of streaming options it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever as well  various live streams on youtube together registered more than 25 million simultaneous viewers live streams on other sites also reached millions of people  on both twitter and facebook trump was a livelier subject than clinton twitter said the final share of conversation around the candidates on stage was 62 for trump and 38 for clinton  on facebook the results were even more lopsided with trump earning 79 share of conversation and clinton having the remaining 21  being talked about isnt necessarily a good thing for a candidate most commentators gave clinton the edge over trump after the debate  still the postdebate coverage on tv focused on trump partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage  cnns reality check team investigated 26 claims made by clinton and trump and found that trump made a greater number of misleading statements

united nations cnn president barack obama made an impassioned plea tuesday for countries to fulfill a moral obligation to alleviate a global refugee crisis of epic proportions despite a political backlash in the us against absorbing those fleeing middle east violence  the presidents interest in calling attention to the tens of millions of displaced people around the world and pushing back against the antirefugee tenor was underscored by his decision to convene a leaders summit on refugees at the united nations tuesday  at the summit he also rejected another aspect of the american political debate swirling around accepting foreigners  gop presidential nominee donald trumps call to build a wall along the usmexico border  this crisis is a test of our common humanity whether we give into suspicion and fear and build walls or whether we see ourselves in another obama said though he didnt mention trump by name  obama singled out the situation in syria which has displaced 48 million people so far as particularly unacceptable  just watched president obama at the un then and now replay more videos  must watch president obama at the un then and now 0145  we are not as unified as we should be in pushing to make it stop he said describing the global refugee crisis as both a humanitarian and security challenge that tests countries ability to take collective action  i called this summit because this crisis is one of the most urgent tests of our time he said just as failure to act in the past  for example by turning away jews fleeing nazi germany  is a stain on our collective conscience i believe history will judge us harshly if we do not rise to this moment  the refugee issue is one thats captured the worlds attention more in the past two years than at perhaps any time since world war ii seared into the publics consciousness by photos like that of a 3yearold syrian boy who drowned in the mediterranean and the flood of migrants into europe  a recent study by from the uns refugee agency estimated 653 million people were displaced from their homes by conflict or persecution in 2015 up by over five million from the prior year many are internally displaced within the borders of their own countries but about 213 million are classified as refugees  obamas summit follows a similar unled meeting on the issue monday which drew attention to the crisis but offered little in the way of binding commitments  make no mistake us secretary of state john kerry said at the un meeting additional efforts are urgently needed  leaders also called for a more orderly and equitable system to manage refugee flows  acknowledging the burden is shouldered disproportionally by certain regions  you have to know that today the european union has a clear objective to restore order on its external borders european council president donald tusk said in his remarks signaling a growing sense that patience in europe with the migrant flow is wearing thin  there will be no repeat of the year 2015 with more than one and a half million irregular migrants he added  the obama administration is hopeful the leaders summit on tuesday afternoon can build momentum for more action  national security advisor susan rice in june announced that the gathering  cohosted along with the us by canada ethiopia germany jordan mexico sweden and the un secretary general  would seek an increase in funding of at least 30 a doubling of permanent resettlement and expanded access to education and work rights for refugees  reaching these ambitious objectives will be challenging yet the level of need demands no less rice said in a statement  but aid groups are skeptical the summit will prompt the kind of action they say is desperately needed  we have to be optimistic that well see some real concrete commitments said amnesty internationals interim executive director margaret huang but the truth is even if those numbers are hit its nowhere near whats actually needed  the us is a major contributor of humanitarian aid for countries that host large numbers of refugees  particularly syrias neighbors  and plans to increase the number of refugees it will take in to america from 85000 in 2016 to 110000 next year  the presidents chief spokesman last week conceded that even as the administration calls for greater global action it is limited in what it can do  the presidents commitment to ensuring that the united states plays a leading role on this issue is not shared by a lot of people in congress including by a lot of people in the republican majority in congress press secretary josh earnest told reporters and that has an impact in terms of the resources that are dedicated to this effort  vetting efforts to screen refugees he noted are not cheap  david miliband president of the international rescue committee and a former british foreign secretary said hes hopeful but waiting to see whether any agreements are backed up with action  the scale of the global refugee problem demands an appropriate scale of response miliband told cnn governments around the world havent in the main been responding with the right degree of compassion or competence up to now  but the cohosts of the leaders summit said in a statement they were pleased with new and significant humanitarian contributions from world leaders  we sought a 3 billion increase in global humanitarian financing and commitments to maintain funding in future years they said through our mutual efforts over the course of 2016 the 32 donors participating today have contributed this year roughly 45 billion additional dollars to un appeals and international humanitarian organizations than in 2015  as they await action from world leaders in new york a group of volunteers in london laid out a life jacket graveyard monday to draw attention to the plight of thousands of migrants whove lost their lives attempting hazardous boat crossings in the mediterranean  the conflict in syria and resulting migrant crisis in the middle east and europe have dominated headlines over the past 18 months but refugees are a global problem  perhaps nowhere are they more prevalent than in the socalled global south  the developing countries of the southern hemisphere last week south sudan joined the ranks of syria afghanistan and somalia  countries with over 1 million of their citizens living as refugees abroad  and protracted conflict in places like somalia have led to a generation of lifelong refugees  men and women in their twenties whove never known life outside of a camp  these are not people who can envision what life would be like if they were returned to their home countries huang said

kendall jenner cries over pepsi ad backlash in keeping up with the kardashians premiere  remember pepsis tonedeaf kendall jenner commercial back in april the one that made people furious because it appropriated images from black lives matter protests to sell soda  pepsi quickly pulled the ad after intense criticism  and in the six months since the controversy kendall hasnt publicly responded thats because she saved it all for the 14th season premiere of es keeping up with the kardashians which aired sunday night the kardashian family has said that kendall was very upset over the backlash and the premiere confirmed that yes the 21yearold supermodel was mortified  although the episode ended with kendall sobbing obviously if i knew that this was going to be the outcome i would have never done something like this it was a slow build to her breakdown in fact the word pepsi never came up during the entire hour it all started as kendall called her sisters kourtney and khloe kardashian  are you okay kourtney said when she answered the phone you sound so sad  i talked to simon today kourtney said likely referring to simon huck a public relations guru and kim kardashian wests close friend he was like the news lasts 24 hours  cut to an oncamera interview with khloe who explained to the audience kendall did a commercial and basically caused a huge controversy it sucks because kendalls been taking the blame for it all kendall tries really hard to be socially conscious and aware of the jobs that she takes and to really think about how things affect other people so it weighs really heavy on her heart  producers showed some critical tweets about the commercial such as so many adults had to f up in so many unique and equally tone deaf ways to make this awful ad its honestly breathtaking  kourtney assured kendall that she spoke to family friend russell simmons who said that kendall can turn this into a positive this is never further explained after they hung up kourtney told khloe that it sounded like kendall was crying  later kendall explained why she filmed the commercial in the first place  when she got the offer she was thrilled to join the list of celebrities who have done pepsi ads from michael jackson to beyoncé to britney spears  i trusted everyone i trusted the teams she told the camera but after i saw the reaction and i read what people had to say about it i most definitely saw what went wrong i was so stuck and i really didnt know what to do that i completely shut down  the following scene showed kendall sitting forlornly in her gigantic walkin closet talking to kim on the phone the new issue her father caitlyn jenner was going on a book tour kendall was worried that caitlyn might say something about the commercial that would make things worse  she just tends to like say a lot and i just would rather everyone just not say anything kendall said i mean god bless her for trying  i know but caitlyn is known for saying all the wrong things kim said she promised to call caitlyn and let her know it was a very sensitive subject  so kim called caitlyn and told her not to answer questions about the pepsi ad  and if she felt compelled just say something along the lines of kendall had the best intentions with this being something like peaceful and she totally gets everyones point of view now it was not appropriate and shes so sorry  naturally caitlyn did not follow that advice and instead talked about the commercial in a radio interview and said kendall knew all about the ads script beforehand and thought it was fine the episode ended as kendall went to talk to kim about three weeks after the commercial was pulled she was upset about caitlyn and even more about the whole situation  i just feel really really bad like i feel really bad that anyone was ever offended i feel really bad that this was taken such a wrong way kendall said i genuinely feel like s and i have no idea how im going to bounce back from it  this is the first time youve had a scandal kim gently reminded her this is your first real experience with something like this  the text messages i would get from people theyd be like its going to be fine like you know everything blows over in like a weeks time or whatever and im just like okay but its been like three weeks and its not going anywhere  kendall said  yeah but it will kim assured her this is just going to be the biggest lesson learned for you  i really dont even know what to do at this point its really depressing and it bothers me every single day kendall said  youre the last person to want to hurt someone or be insensitive but its like it really sucks i think the only thing you can really do is just be real and honest because you cant ignore it like you cant kim said it should affect you in a way where you grow from it and youre like okay im a better person from it    i just wish that you could see that theres light at the end of the tunnel  despite kims words of wisdom kendall still broke down crying to the camera  i would never purposely hurt someone ever kendall said tearfully you dont know when youre in the moment and like it was the most  she grappled for the right words i just felt so fing stupid the fact that i would offend other people or hurt other people was definitely not the intent and thats what got me the most is that i would have ever made anyone else upset  after pepsi pulled the ad the company apologized for putting kendall jenner in an awkward position last week pepsi chief executive indra nooyi told fortune that she didnt initially see the ads final scene that caused so much consternation in which jenner handed a cop a can of pepsi  this has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to black lives matter made me scratch my head i had not seen that scene nooyi said and i take everything personally the minute i saw people upset i pulled it and you know what its not worth it there were people on both sides but at the end of the day our goal is not to offend anybody  clearly we missed the mark pepsi pulls kendall jenner ad and apologizes  the kardashians arent thrilled with caitlyn jenners new book

78k shares share this story  a ninetysixyearold world war ii veteran and longtime new yorker contributor roger angell has voted in eighteen elections as he prepares to vote in his nineteenth he has published an oped in which he shares his wisdom and experience  and sends a dire warning to the american people  this man who has lived through the most dangerous threats to ever face our nation including the prospect of nuclear armageddon believes that the election of republican nominee donald trump would be a catastrophe on the same level  my country faces a danger unmatched in our history since the cuban missile crisis in 1962 or perhaps since 1943 when the axis powers held most of continental europe and imperial japan controlled the pacific rim from the aleutians to the solomon islands with the outcome of that war still unknown   angell acknowledges trumps long history of outrageously offensive statements but chooses to focus on the one closest to his heart military service and the lessons of the second world war the most destructive conflict humanity has ever fought  i stick at a different momentthe lighthearted comment he made when in early august an admiring veteran presented him with a replica of his purple heart and mr trump said i always wanted to get the purple heart this was much easier mr trump is saying he wishes that he had joined the armed forces somehow he had a chance but skimmed out like so many others of his time and then had died or been scarred or maimed in combat this is the dream of a nineyearold boy and it impugns the five hundred thousand young americans who have died in combat in my lifetime and the many hundreds of thousands more whose lives were altered or shattered by their wounds of war i take this personally representing as i do the last sliver of the sixteen million americans who served in the military in my wari experienced the loss of more than twenty close friends classmates and companions of my youth who remain young and fresh in memory i have named them in previous pieces along with some wounded survivors like my friend gardner an infantry captain who landed at normandy beach and fought at hürtgen forest and aachen and the battle of the bulge was twice woundedmy late brotherinlaw neil who lay wounded on the field for two days during the battle of belfort gap and who hobbled with a cane all his life and with two canes near the end every american of my generation can supply stories like these and once learned and tried to forget that worldwide seventy million people died in our war  far too many people have forgotten the lessons of that dreadful conflict  or never learned them at all as in trumps case trump is a selfish coward at his core a draftdodger who then had the nerve to compare his promiscuity with the sacrifices of the hundreds of thousands of young americans who perished in the jungles of vietnam a man who mocks war heroes and insults the families of our slain warriors a man who uses our veterans for cheap propaganda stunts and tosses them aside once theyve served their purpose  trump is uniquely illsuited for the presidency a man enslaved by his ego and devoid of principle  negatives that deeply disturb mr angell  mr trump is endlessly on record as someone who will not back down who cannot appear to pause or lose he is a man who must win stay on the attack and who thinks first and last how will i look this is central and what comes after it for me at times is concern for what it must be like for anyone who facing an imperative as dark and unforgiving as this finds only the narcissists mirror for reassurance  on the other hand mr angell has glowing praise for democratic nominee hillary clinton a woman who has spent her entire life in public service who has shown time and time again that she has a backbone of steel and is up to the pressures of the presidency  i will cast my own vote for hillary clinton with alacrity and confidence from the beginning her life has been devoted to public service and to improving the lives of children and the disadvantaged she is intelligent strong profoundly informed and extraordinarily experienced in the challenges and risks of our lurching restlessly altering world and wholly committed to the global commonality her wellestablished connections to minorities may bring some better understanding of our urban and suburban police crisis ms clinton will make a strong and resolute presidentat last a female leader of our ownand in the end perhaps a unifying one  he saves his best criticism for the end however as he nervously ponders what a president trump might be responding to an ordinary day in the white house  if donald trump wins this election his nights in the white house will very soon resemble those of president obama a new day is arriving and with it the latest rush of bad newsanother police shooting out west another suicide bomber in yemen and other urgent briefings from a world already caught up in the mornings difficult events he needs to respond but the beginning of this presidents response is always reliably at hand how will i look  we absolutely cannot elect a president that will put his own public image above the needs of the american people  read the full article here  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

donald trumps campaign isnt alone in patronizing his own businesses taxpayers are indirectly doing so too  federal election commission records show that the us secret service has paid the trump campaign about 16 million to cover the cost of flying its agents with the candidate on a plane owned and operated by one of his companies  story continued below  its standard practice for the agency  which is tasked with protecting presidential candidates as well as presidents and other federal officials  to reimburse presidential campaigns for the cost of traveling with the candidates  in fact the secret service has reimbursed the clinton campaign too 26 million so far this cycle  the difference with trump is that one of his companies tag air inc owns the plane so the government is effectively paying him  the clinton campaign by contrast mostly has been chartering planes from a private company called executive fliteways in which the clintons do not have any ownership interest  the taxpayers are actually reimbursing trump for the travel of the secret service agents said brett kappel a campaign finance lawyer at the law firm akerman llp its just another example of how the trump campaign has taken an unprecedentedly large amount of its money and spent it at trumpowned facilities  trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks responded to questions about the secret service payments by saying everything was done in accordance with fec guidelines and regulations please direct further questions to usss  secret service spokeswoman nicole mainor said the fec specifically requires security personnel such as the secret service to reimburse campaigns for seats on charter aircraft  a politico analysis of fec records found that through the end of august trumps campaign has spent at least 82 million at trumps own businesses including to hold events at his hotels buy food from his restaurants and rent office space for its headquarters in his manhattan office tower  but the biggest chunk of the expenses almost 6 million were to tag air inc  trump who once said i could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it has attracted criticism for mixing business and politics to an unprecedented degree he has made a point of highlighting his properties on the campaign trail leading opponents to accuse him of using his presidential bid to promote his brand and line his pockets  the campaign in a statement on thursday rejected that criticism as misleading and flat out wrong pointing out that the amount the campaign spent at trumps businesses is far less than the 54 million of his own money that trump has pumped into the campaign  the statement explained the campaigns payments to tag air and other trumpowned companies by saying the campaign has used known quantities as far as event space air travel and accommodations and has fulfilled all fec requirements throughout the campaign  the governments practice of reimbursing campaigns for costs incurred by their secret service details dates from an era when campaigns were lowerbudget affairs the logic being candidates shouldnt have to use their own resources on required security according to craig engle a political lawyer at arent fox who helped draft the provision as a staffer at the federal election commission  its basically just calling it even engle said its either trump making a contribution to the us government or the us government reimburses the trump campaign for its expenses  the same rationale applies to journalists who travel with the presidential candidates the journalists or their employers reimburse the campaigns for travel costs so its conceivable that media outlets might end up paying the trump campaign for the cost of staying in a trumpowned hotel or flying on a trumpowned plane  the secret service could also end up paying trumps hotels to put up his agents when the candidate stays there but those expenses dont appear in fec reports because the government pays them directly  the agency paid the trump campaign an additional 724000 for air travel that was refunded according to the fec reports which do not offer an explanation for the refund  of course trump also travels on the campaign trail with his own robust private security detail in august trumps campaign spent 232800 on securityrelated costs including payments to private companies such as xmark llc black tie protection services and ks global group as well as local police in places he visited    authors

from which he was later deported  the hamlet of 1200 people lies nestled among vineyardcovered hills about an hourandahalfs drive southwest of frankfurt it has one bakery and one butcher every year kallstadt holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy pigs stomach filled with pork herbs bratwurst and diced potatoes  trump may have captured a large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism nativism and brazenness and yet in the hometown of his forefather he remains distinctly unpopular  in fact few politicians are less popular in germany than trump a study by the pew research center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy  since a local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger a member of the german parliament was distantly related to trump the 29yearold has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate with his statements about gay people and foreigners or with the language he uses and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him steiniger tells politico  trumps rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in kallstadt he stands for everything thats bad says sarah bühler yelling to be heard over the 20person brass band celebrating the saumagenkerwe in the towns main square bühler is a former local wine princess the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry  this year a new dish appeared in the towns annual festival saumagendöner a fusion of the local specialty with a turkish kebab everyone is welcome to join us here no matter what color they are says bühler pink purple doesnt matter  tanja huber the 24yearold incumbent regional wine princess nods her head in agreement since the prospect of a trump presidency first became evident late last year reporters have descended on kallstadt seeking a bit of local color a quote or two and perhaps some hometown pride they dont get that we really dont give a damn about trump says huber hes never been here and he apparently doesnt care about us either      donalds grandfather friedrich trump was born in kallstadt into a vintners family on march 14 1869 previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name including trump dromb and trumpff according to local historians or even drumpf according to a 2000 family history by gwenda blair but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on trump  germany did not yet exist as a nation kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom the region was going though rough times unemployment was high those who had the courage left  friedrichs father died when he was eight years old and his mother struggled to make ends meet at 16 years old friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier he arrived in new york on board the eider on october 19 1885  he entered the us through official channels but he had left bavaria illegally both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service said roland paul the recentlyretired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern  according to documents uncovered by paul friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship as his own request four years after arriving in the us  but friedrich was not done with palatinate seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister according to the 2000 family history by blair five years after that he returned once more to kallstadt where he met 20yearold elisabeth christ they were engaged and friedrich came back a third time to marry her in august 1902  but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had a daughter friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the us and return to the land of their birth my grandmother said i will marry you but i will not go back to america with you donald trumps americanborn cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in 2012  friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise in 1904 he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt and although he claimed in his application that he intended to return to the united states within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein he took all his savings from the us with him according to blairs family history  back in kallstadt friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back but though he secured the support of local authorities the district government put a halt to his plans on february 27 1905 a deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may 1 of this year at the latest  friedrich was able to obtain a threemonth grace period because his daughter had fallen ill but eventually he and his wife  pregnant once more  had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july 1 1905 and return to new york shortly after that donalds father fred trump junior was born  the authorities said you are not a german citizen you gave up your citizenship you have to leave says walter so they left and they went back to america and thats why donald and i are here  friedrich  now named frederick  died in may 1918 of the spanish flu his widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited kallstadt many times during her life      in february 2012 simone wendel the german filmmaker from kallstadt was given an audience with donald trump roughly two years earlier she had begun work on kings of kallstadt a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown donald trump and henry john heinz the inventor of heinz ketchup  for months wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with trump but his office had not replied to her letters she was only able to secure a visit with the help of walter trumps cousin who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history  on the day of her visit wendel stood nervously next to walter in a conference room on one of trump towers top floors she had brought a linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screwon tops  her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake the traditional afternoon snack in her home region but when she asked trumps staff to make some coffee the only reaction she got was irritated faces his assistant just couldnt be bothered she says  hello john trump said when he entered the room shaking his cousins hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her  trump sat down in front of a onemeterlong model of his boeing 757200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking new yorks central park wendel trying to remedy the situation pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it afterwards i just kept on thinking what on earth did i do she says  the cake looks really good trump said and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour  until 1990 trump still claimed his family was swedish a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the antigerman sentiment in the us during the two world wars but by the time wendel visited he had become proud of his german roots they grow them well in kallstadt he told her during their meeting they grow them very well believe me its good stock  wow its beautiful trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born an inconspicuous onestory building with a gable roof thats fantastic see how wellmaintained it is everything is perfectly maintained its great  when their interview was over walter took wendel on a tour of trump tower on one of the floors they ran into trumps son eric trump  have you ever heard the word kallstadt wendel asked him  kallstadt trump junior replied no what is it

guy ritchie enjoys laidback bike ride with son rocco amid claims exwife madonna is close to agreeing a deal for the teen to stay in london  madonna and guy ritchie are battling for custody of son 15 through court judge in manhattan court told them to solve dispute themselves rocco currently lives with father in london and says he wants to stay there source claims madonna close to agreeing so long as he visits us regularly guy was spending quality time with his son amidst legal drama    it was recently reported that madonna is close to agreeing a deal for her son rocco to stay in london with his father guy ritchie after a judge laid into them for dragging the dispute through the courts  and the filmmaker appeared unfazed as he spent some quality time with his 15yearold in the english capital enjoying a leisurely bike ride in the midst of the ongoing crossatlantic custody battle  guy and rocco were clad in matching waterproof jackets and grey hoodies as they indulged in some gentle exercise following the stress of the court hearing earlier this week  the man from uncle director topped off his athletic look with a beanie hat while rocco sported a baseball cap  the teen  who has been living with his father in london since fleeing his mothers rebel heart tour in december  was busy checking his phone as he cycled along behind his dad  rocco is adamant he wants to continue living with his father in london and its claimed madonna is close to agreeing to a deal  the pair have been fighting for custody since december culminating with madonnas lawyers calling for mr ritchie to be arrested this week  but sources say madonna is close to agreeing a deal to let rocco stay in the uk with his father 47 so long as he returns to the us for regular holidays  as news of the deal emerged madonna posted a bizarre video of herself online with the caption tears of a clown  the 10second video shows the singer spinning and tapdancing on a catwalk in a red polkadot suit and mask  the deal could finally be an end to the dispute which has been dragged through the courts since december when the 15yearold refused to go back to new york to see his mother  a source close to the couple said its obvious they cant force rocco to return and the judge was told hes too old to be forced reports the sun  but madonna wants to make sure she regularly sees him and they spend time together they are just looking at the final details now like public holidays  just yesterday lawyers for madonna demanded that the stars exhusband guy ritchie be arrested for contempt of court for not abiding terms agreed in their divorce in 2008  her legal team made the dramatic demand during a bitter court hearing in new york which both she and ritchie were listening to by phone  madonnas lawyer eleanor alter said that ritchie should have brought rocco to new york to resolve the dispute because he was required to according to terms in the legallybinding divorce  she said he taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and i think thats one of the most serious things thats happened in this case thats detrimental to rocco  alter said that ritchies conduct was contempt and the court went so far as to discuss the possibility that a warrant could be issued for ritchies arrest  she added that the contempt should be enforced but new york supreme court justice deborah kaplan refused to issue the warrant for ritchies arrest  ritchies lawyer peter bronstein angrily rejected the demand from madonnas team and said that his client had not even been held in contempt so an arrest was not being considered yet  justice kaplan scolded both ritchie and madonna and said their son just wanted the case over  she said frankly both parties have chosen to live their lives in a very public way and may welcome the publicity but the child has not  he would like this matter resolved and the issues concerning him and his family in the most private way possible  lawyers for both sides grew increasingly illtempered as the hearing went on  see more of the latest madonna updates as she fights for custody of her son rocco  alter for madonna said that things she had been told by mr bronstein about english law had proved to be incorrect and that some of the protections shed hoped for had not materialised  she said that did not have an agreement on any part of the case  mr bronstein said that ritchie and madonna had been speaking directly to each other and by yesterday had drawn up an agreement which they had summarized into 24 points  it broke down because of a number of issues including measures that allowed david banda the son madonna adopted while married to ritchie to visit rocco in london but make sure he returns to new york  mr bronstein said there were still a number of differences which are extremely important to my client and i understand to the child  he went on to say that he had refrained from filing a number of papers which could be emotionally disturbing to rocco in the hope that an agreement could be reached  he asked the court to lift justice kaplans order from december requiring that rocco return to new york but she rebuffed him  justice kaplan told him that under the terms of madonna and ritchies divorce which was agreed in london in 2008 the manhattan supreme court had ultimate authority over any custody matters not the high court in london  instead ritchie has been going to the london court for hearings over the row the court was told another one was due to take place in london on thursday  justice kaplan urged both sides not to take up what she called entrenched positions and think about what was best for the child  she said that she thought that both parties were coming very very close to a global resolution that would take the child out of the unending spotlight  alter seized on this and said that ritchies conduct amounted to contempt she said he thought it was better for rocco to live with him  he may be right i dont know but the proper procedure was to come back to new york and ask for a change in circumstances he used selfhelp  he taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and i think thats one of the most serious things thats happened in this case thats detrimental to rocco  mr bronstein said that the mere suggestion ritchie could be arrested cast a dark pall over the hearing and said that the boy should be able to live in a normal household with his father present  roccos lawyer ellen sigal said that the teenager wanted his parents to put in place measures that will heal the rift that has arisen  she said that the case was proving to be a very difficult time for him and that that she hoped he would not be exposed to any more distress and innuendo  she said that rocco felt that the case was stressful and upsetting he is currently attending school in london and that she hoped roccos parents come to an agreement that will shield him from this matter  madonna appeared by phone from new zealand where she is due to play the next date in her rebel heart tour ritchies location was not disclosed but is likely to have been london  she spoke only at the start of hearing when asked is that miss ciccone and she replied yes its me  ritchie only spoke to confirm he was on the phone too  earlier justice kaplan had agreed to let the press remain in the court because she did not believe that coverage of the case would cause a negative impact to rocco  she said that the case had attracted extraordinary media attention and that she had to balance the need for public access with the harmful effects on rocco  the judge also allowed a single photographer in to take still photos of the hearing  the case is to resume on 1 june  the couple were married in skibo castle in scotland in a high profile ceremony attended by gwyneth paltrow donatella versace and stella mccartney  madonna is also the mother to 19yearold daughter lourdes leon from her previous relationship to carlos leon and adopted children david banda 10 and mercy james also 10  david was adopted while she was still married to guy  guy meanwhile has gone on to have three children with wife jacqui ainsley sons rafael four and levi one and daughter rivka three  ritchie had been seen walking in london before the case was heard  he and his superstar singer ex have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over their teenager for the past few months  madonna has used social media to attempt to appeal to her son  two weeks ago she shared a nostalgic snapshot of herself with baby rocco reminiscing about happier times  along with the snap she wrote tu me manquesic translated as i miss you  while some of her french fans were quick to point out that she had spelt manques wrong most of her followers chimed in with messages of love and support reassuring the star that rocco would no doubt change his mind  be strong he will come back he is just a teenager one posted while another enthused he will always be your son and you always his mother  rocco is said to have moved in which his father 47 his model wife jacqui ainsley 34 and their three children after becoming fed up with being on tour with his mother  he was supposed to spend christmas with her but did not return home to new york  madonna went to the manhattan supreme court in december to try to force rocco to come home  but during the hearing ritchies lawyer eric buckley said that rocco had expressed very clearly that he did not want to be with her  one possible source of roccos frustration is that madonna posted numerous pictures and videos of him on instagram that could have caused him embarrassment  in may she posted one video of him doing a backflip wearing orange underwear with the caption roccos preferred profile nosausage  in an interview in august madonna said that rocco did not want to perform on stage with her and would be working backstage on her tour as your mom is not cool at his age  the row has reopened old wounds from her and guys divorce after eight years together and put madonna at the center of a painful and public battle  madonna reportedly thinks guys parenting is too lax and is said to have hired private detectives to spy on rocco who took pictures of him smoking underage

nine years ago a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the confederate monument on the front lawn of the franklin county courthouse decapitating the marble soldier some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised the soldier would be back  the rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 peoplewomen wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of confederate soldiers were very proud of it says linda stanley managing director of the franklin county historical society in rocky mount virginia 25 miles southeast of roanoke this whole countys very very patriotic  story continued below  this was the way skirmishes over confederate history have often gonehistory is replaced not rewritten that is until last year when white supremacist dylann roof gunned down nine people at an africanamerican church in charleston south carolina the massacre set off a national debate about confederate symbols in public places leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the confederate flag from the south carolina capitol grounds where it had flown for decades  but for every nationally publicized debate like the one over south carolinas flag there are dozens of smaller battles in places like franklin county and this is especially true in virginia which as the former home to the capital of the confederacy has more confederate monuments223than any other state virginia increasingly diverse and progressive embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the new south and the still powerful nostalgia of the old dominion and its a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state  though a quinnipiac university poll last summer found virginians evenly divided on the governors decision to remove the confederate flag from state license plates pride in local monuments remains strong when city leaders in danville on virginias southern border voted to remove a confederate flag from the grounds of the sutherlin mansionknown as the last capitol of the confederacyconfederate preservationists struck back they filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated arguing that it was part of a war memorial and that virginia law protected all war memorials in the state last fall a circuit court judge ruled against them  that rulingalong with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the stateprompted the republican delegate from franklin county to demand in january a blanket protection for what has been a feature of southern urban landscapes for more than a century charles poindexter introduced a bill in the general assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments regardless of when they were built if you eliminate these monuments and memorials youre taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the countryto learn the good the bad and ugly poindexter says  many of his colleagues in the virginia legislature agreed with him but in march democratic governor terry mcauliffe vetoed the bill saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their confederate monuments based on their individual histories some historians and civic leaders think the debate over confederate symbols in public spaces which began in the 1960s will take decades to play out  every little statues a part of a much larger discussion and movement says edward ayers former president of the university of richmond and noted civil war historian africanamericans now have a political voice and this is one of the things that theyre using it for    mark whitaker remembers walking by the 30foottall confederate monument in portsmouth virginia when he was a kid shopping at a store across the street he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers his parents had told him what it represented my ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity whitaker says  now as an africanamerican city council member in a city that is 53 percent black he wants to remove the monument from the center of olde towne and perhaps put it in a cemetery these monuments are really a rally and a celebration of the rise of an institution that oppressed black people he says  many of the confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s an era when civil war veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them it was also the era immediately following reconstruction when federal troops abandoned the south and whites aimed to reassert power through jim crow laws lynchings and groups such as the ku klux klan granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power often in the center of town  but even in a majorityblack city on the eastern shore of the state whitaker has battled to get portsmouths monument removed last summer attorney fred taylor who also represented confederate preservationists in the danville case warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument we believe the monument protection act covers the monument in danville covers the monument in portsmouth taylor says he argues that the original virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902 so there has been protection all along  when the circuit court judge ruled against him in danville taylor appealed the case to the virginia supreme court so far the court has not agreed to hear the case  back in portsmouth the debate continues some residents dont want the city to spend upward of 100000 to move the monumenta position whitaker finds ridiculous why now when we talk about moving a symbol of racism were concerned about cost  he says the portsmouth city council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the november elections were on solid legal grounds to remove it he says we just need four votes    other virginia cities have struck a middle ground forming committees to figure out what to do with their confederate monuments in may charlottesville convened a blue ribbon commission on race memorials and public spaces although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of robert e lee in a public park mayor mike signer was determined to broaden the conversation with an eye toward changing the citys entire historic landscape  he asked the commission to look at several landmarks from an africanamerican cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a confederate boy in front of the courthouse members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites building new monuments to africanamerican leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected there might even be a virtual mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites the goal signer says is to change the narrative of charlottesville by telling the full story of race through our public spaces the commission is slated to give its recommendations to the city council in december  in the wealthy heavily democratic city of alexandria a similar advisory group decided not to remove the appomattox statue in the middle of old town which depicts a defeated confederate soldier with his eyes downcast the united daughters of the confederacy owns the monument and moving it would require approval from the virginia general assembly also as the advisory group noted appomattox is one of the rare confederate statues that marks a historic sitethe place where the 17th virginia regiment gathered to withdraw from union occupation of the city in 1861 the group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down  black lives matter is spray painted on a monument to former confederate president jefferson davis in richmond virginia in june 2015  ap photo  richmond the former capital of the confederacy has an entire street lined with monuments to confederate leaders its also a majorityblack city in june 2015 someone scrawled black lives matter on the statue of former confederate president jefferson davis yet mayor dwight jones has not called for the monuments removal instead he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaderssuch as the bronze of tennis legend arthur ashe who was born in richmond that the city erected in 1995 rather than tearing down we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of virginias history jones said in a statement last summer  delegate poindexter tends to agree with jones although hes fuzzy on the specifics asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing confederate monuments he says its far better than tearing down the current ones  in his eyes the era in which the confederate monuments were erected is irrelevant they need to be respected he says they didnt know what we know today thats why these monuments are important  ayers says many people who push to preserve confederate monuments share this attitude the white south has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the united states he says theyve taken what ground they can get and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization its an amalgam of power and weakness  theyre meant to do work ayers says the work that they were meant to do in some ways theyre still doing saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots    in franklin county the power struggle is deeply personal stanley says the area sent about 3000 confederate soldiers to what she calls the war between the states veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates beginning in 1902 the local chapter of the united daughters of the confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons fathers and husbands who never made it home they dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910  one of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was booker t washington the famed africanamerican educator who was born into slavery on a farm in franklin county in 1856 in 1905 he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the confederate memorial in honor of the family that owned him as far as stanley knows washington did contribute some amount we just dont have a copy of the actual check  poindexter says franklin county lost hundreds of its best men in the civil war and for decades afterward reconstruction was a horrible process that had a big impact on the region  today franklin county is home to about 56200 people 90 percent of whom are white they elected poindexter a conservative christian with an a rating from the national rifle association to the general assembly for the first time in 2007 in 2014 the county had a median household income of 44827 far below the states median of 64792 its residents voted republican in the past three presidential races and many supported poindexters efforts to save war monuments we didnt want anybody pulling any monuments down stanley says  soon after the county replaced the confederate memorial in front of the courthouse the local chapter of the naacp suggested that a statue of booker t washington be erected beside it other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring africanamericans who contributed to the countys civil war effort the county board of supervisors tabled their request saying the community needed more time to discuss it  civil war memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the roanoke region says landon howard president of visit virginias blue ridge to be candid we really do not get hardly any american civil war visitation here  yet locals have their own loyalties every year the franklin county historical society celebrates veterans memorial day honoring all local casualties of military conflicts according to the societys website special emphasis is placed on veterans of the war between the states as this war touched literally every household in the county  confederate general jubal early was born in franklin county and hes known as one of the rebels who never surrendered he became the primary spokesman for the lost cause and became the overwhelming authority on published confederate history says the website of the jubal a early homeplace  speaking by phone from his farm in franklin county poindexter isnt ready to surrender either he doesnt know whether hell propose his monument protection bill again next year but he hasnt ruled it out if you start tearing down monuments  where do you stop he says you cant change what was but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again  lisa rab is a journalist in charlotte nc her work has appeared in mother jones and the village voice among other outlets reach her at

newark cnn former port authority executives and new jersey gov chris christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the september 2013 lane closures at the george washington bridge as bad as possible according to testimony heard in federal court monday  david wildstein former port authority director of interstate capital projects testified that in june 2013 bridget kelly christies former deputy chief of staff was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the democratic mayor of fort lee new jersey mark sokolich for christies reelection campaign  wildstein who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation told kelly that shutting down access lanes to the george washington bridge to put some political pressure on sokolich was an option according to his testimony  wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal sokolich testified last week that being a democrat in a democratic town put him in an uncomfortable position visavis a christie endorsement and he eventually declined because he did not want to alienate anyone  on august 13 2013 and as cnn has previously reported wildstein received an email from kelly saying time for some traffic problems in fort lee  got it wildstein responded  a phone call with kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward it was revealed in testimony monday  i did not question senior officials in the office of the governor wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision  wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures and communicated every step of the way with kelly and his thenboss former port authority deputy executive director bill baroni according to his testimony  wildstein and kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to fort lee officials or the public they discussed how the port authority would respond to any inquiries and agreed that all calls would be directed to baronis office and baroni would not return the calls testimony revealed  this radio silence policy was discussed with and approved by baroni wildstein said  wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to maximize the impact on fort lee wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with baroni and kelly  baroni asked when the first day of school in fort lee was and when wildstein told baroni it was september 9 baroni smiled and said fantastic according to wildsteins testimony kelly agreed on the september 9 date  wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three fort lee access lanes but after discussing the matter with port authority engineers who feared this could cause sideswipe crashes wildstein recommended to baroni and kelly that they shut down two lanes  on friday september 6 2013 wildstein informed several port authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on monday september 9  bob durando port authority general manager of the george washington bridge expressed concern telling wildstein that the closures would cause a mess  wildstein told durando the closures would be going forward and to prepare accordingly  i told him not to say anything to anybody wildstein testified wildstein told durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to baronis office  wildstein then informed former port authority chief engineer peter zipf of the closures and asked zipf to organize a way to get some numbers on the traffic patterns  wildstein also informed cedrick fulton port authority director of tunnels bridges and terminals fulton asked if port authority executive director patrick foye was aware wildstein testified that he told fulton yes but that this was a lie  all of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study  on the day the closures began wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a port authority administration building on the fort lee side of the george washington bridge  i knew the plan that i had set into motion was working wildstein testified  a port authority lieutenant also drove wildstein around fort lee so wildstein could see the traffic on the ground  wildstein testified that he called kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up and she was pleased  several calls and emails began coming in to baroni and wildstein from fort lee officials including the mayor sokolich but their plan of radio silence was put into effect and no messages were returned  last week wildstein testified that baronis role at the bistate agency was essentially to be a representative of christies administration and that their top priority was to represent christies offices interests  wildstein said he created a phrase that he and baroni often used the one constituent rule this referred to the fact that governor christies opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to port authority affairs wildstein and baroni used the one constituent rule as a barometer by which decisions would be made  kelly and baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with bridgegate their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses

rep peter king we shouldnt be pandering to political correctness  new york rep peter king rejected former secretary of state hillary clintons focus on the need for law enforcement to do a better job of building trust with american muslims instead the 11term congressman called for more surveillance within the community  i disagree with her when she puts the emphasis on building trust with the muslim community they have no reason not to trust the police king said on msnbc shortly after clinton answered questions from the press on the weekends bombing in manhattan  story continued below  king is not new to this topic his insistence to hold hearings on homegrown radicalization within islam drew comparisons to sen joseph mccarthys infamous communist witch hunt king has said he considers such attacks on him a badge of honor as she has before clinton called for an intelligence surge to thwart isils efforts to inspire terror but cautioned against a broader offensive against a faith  but the only way to gather such intelligence king said is to step up surveillance  so listen its not going to be the handshake of a friendship thats going to bring muslim americans outside king said to get more intelligence you have to do that by surveillance by undercovers thats what has been done with every other ethnic group in this country when there is crime whether its the westies and the irish whether its the italians and the mafia thats how you do it we shouldnt be pandering to political correctness  authors

hillary clintons campaign is making one plea ahead of monday nights big debate dont let donald trump get away with it  and trumps campaign is firing right back arguing that the press is biased against the republican nominee and in any case clintons team is just trying to game the refs  story continued below  the debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening white house race with trump drawing even or ahead in national and battlegroundstate surveys polling averages now show that clintons postconvention lead has evaporated and no less a guru than nate silver declared on monday morning that the race is a dead heat  the latest polling is consistent with a clinton lead of only 1 nationally state firewall breaking up trend lines awful silver tweeted  during the critical hours of expectationsetting ahead of the 9 pm showdown at hofstra university both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard with clintons aides explicitly requesting that moderator lester holt factcheck trump in real time  we are concerned that donald trump may lie he may throw misinformation out there and that hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish clinton campaign manager robby mook told cbs this morning adding that all the campaign is asking of holt is that if trump lies that that simply be checked  the thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves who have been selected by the commission because they will be seen as fair and evenhanded what bothers us mark is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs trump campaign manager kellyanne conway shot back in an interview on msnbc  but conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending trumps claim that holt may be unfair to him because hes a democrat and the system is very unfair the nbc nightly news anchor has been a registered republican in new york since 2003  i dont know that he knew what lester holts voter registration was said conway who went on to dodge multiple queries of why trump lied he didnt lie conway said at one point explaining that a lie would mean that he knew the mans party registration  in a presidential cycle thats seen endless debates about debates mondays theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator after suggesting a debate with no moderator trump has already signaled to holt that he shouldnt try to be candy crowley who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between president barack obama and mitt romney with a factcheck of the gop nominee  but clintons campaign has beat up on holts nbc colleague matt lauer who was widely panned in the media for allowing trumps false assertion that he didnt support the iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month  view one week of hillary clinton factchecks september 24 2016 one week of hillary clinton factchecks september 24 2016  the nonpartisan commission on presidential debates which selected the debate sites and moderators weighed in sunday in our history the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said janet brown the commissions executive director told cnns reliable sources  when it comes to factchecking brown warned i dont think its a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the encyclopedia britannica  for her part clinton wont let trumps lies go by the wayside press secretary brian fallon told cnn on monday insisting that holt shouldnt either  there is enough lies that donald trump tells consistently that everyone by now should be able to call them out he said lester holt hillary clinton will too but i think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates performances should take it into account by now we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the iraq war he lies about his support for the intervention in libya he lies about who started birtherism he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now if he says them again that should be disqualifying he cant possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies  former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski a paid cnn contributor who is still receiving severance from the trump campaign dismissed the idea that a factchecking moderator is of any concern  i think what the concern is from both of the campaigns  and what it should be  is that the moderator is not the person whos running for president of the united states so i think you let the candidates debate you let the candidates answer he said you can hold people accountable theres no question but i dont think its the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so theyre making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate  trumps campaign including his former aide lewandowski also pushed the narrative that clinton is robotic that charge was leveled in response to the clinton camps preparation for two trumps  we dont want donald trumps lies and distortions to be a distraction were hoping that can get checked so that hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do mook told nbcs today  asked about clintons rules of engagement versus trump mook added that it just depends on what donald trump shows up to the debate and we just dont know that  view one week of donald trump factchecks september 24 2016 one week of donald trump factchecks september 24 2016  but conway shot down the notion that theres any other trump while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion lewandowski cast clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is to become human during the debate senior communications adviser jason miller tweeted that overprogramming leads to short circuits and conway joined the pileon  hes not going to be robotic and scripted hillary clinton is conway said and thats a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the united states who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that havent been preprogrammed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates  after mook warned against a double standard where donald trump can get the most improved award but hillary clinton you know is getting judged on the fine points of policy conway added that the two campaign managers are living in parallel universes  i mean donald trump has been criticized all weekend long i think that the clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs has been talking to the media for a week now saying its your job to make sure that donald trump is factchecked in realtime she said im just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate but look they know that campaign debates are not hillary clintons sweet spot yes shes experienced at doing them but the experience hasnt necessarily been beneficial  aside from how holt will moderate conway cited prewritten narratives and what she claimed was clintons willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns  im worried that some of the headlines are already written that theyre conclusions in search of evidence conway said adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut trump ahead of the debate  what i would ask you all to do is start looking at the twitter feeds of quote objective reporters particularly our embeds these are not profiles in courage and this is not journalism there are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on twitter conway said ninetytwo percent of at least two of our embeds tweets are negative towards donald trump why are they on our campaign plane why are they covering our campaign  excuse the trump campaign if we feel like we cant get a fair shake from certain people  conway also indicated that clinton may play the woman card skewing headlines that take away from the real estate moguls performance  so if she ends up saying to him thats just not true youre distorting my record youre being mean to a woman and then people will say he was mean to a woman and the headlines will scream and twitter will blow up  even if its not true she said so that would be my concern that hes not able to get out all of his responses because as joe scarborough correctly points out people are so worried that shes not a great debater that shes not really ready for tonight the way he is that shes going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage  rudy giuliani the former new york mayor and a prominent trump surrogate said he had advised trump to just let loose and be himself  and not try to compete with clintons detailed policy expertise  shes been in government since i was a child i dont remember a time she hasnt been in government in one way or another giuliani said on fox and friends so shes going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has but i think hes going to comport himself very very well and hes going to be  hes just going to be like you see him on  when he comes here on fox news and when you talk to him on the phone hes going to be donald trump  authors

glenn beck shares buyers remorse on cruz endorsement  glenn beck a former ted cruz surrogate suggested monday that hed have been better off backing marco rubio in the republican presidential primary and laced into the texas senator for throwing his support behind donald trump late last week  for the very first time i heard ted cruz calculate and when that happened the whole thing fell apart for me and its my fault beck said on his radio show  story continued below  its my fault beck continued i should have said you know who can win you know who could beat hillary clinton marco rubio and i disagree with him on the gang of eight and theres about 80 percent that i do agree with him on and hes kind of a politician but hes a different kind of politician hes a young politician hes a hispanic he can win lets go for it  instead beck sought a truly honorable man in cruz  and that will always let you down he said but while lamenting the fact that cruz chose to be a politician friday beck said that he believes the texas firebrand is still a good man  im not gonna condemn him he is still i believe a good man beck said he is just a politician first ive never put him into the category of a politician and thats my fault he is a politician  for his part cruz insisted to beck monday that he was trying to show the trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the republican national convention in which he encouraged republicans to vote their conscience in november  after beck noted that cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options vote for trump for clinton a thirdparty candidate write in a candidate or abstain  so a man who has principles who says there are lines i will not cross  its still a binary choice so a man who you cannot come on and say yes glenn he is fit to be president of the united states i still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because its a binary choice beck asked  you are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle cruz shot back warning of the damage he said clinton would do to america  beck however wasnt satisfied this is information that you had in cleveland  and hang on just a second before you respond  you had all of this information you had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that donald trump is a sociopathic liar beck said so you had all this information have you spent an enormous amount of time with donald trump do you have new information that has made you say oh my gosh hes now not a sociopathic liar he is not the guy i very eloquently spelled out for over a year and now suddenly theres a reason to believe him  despite his significant disagreements with trump cruz said its a binary choice  im asking for new information im asking you for new information beck said you knew all the things that youre saying today the time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently why now whats new  cruz pointed to the trump campaigns release of possible conservative supreme court nominees a list that includes cruz ally utah sen mike lee he suggested he had a hand in the list noting that the supreme court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee mike pence when he asked the texas senator what it would take to get him on board  we discussed the supreme court as being one of the great checks protecting the constitution and the rule of law and the trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes cruz said  after stu burguiere pressed cruz on why he would believe anything trump says he rattled off a series of principles at stake now with respect to the justices donald trump would nominate i know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong and if he were to nominate from that list it would be a major step towards protecting our rights cruz said i hope that he would follow through on that commitment one never knows if one will but the fact that he is public promising i will nominate from these 21 i think creates a dynamic where compared to hillary who is promising to put leftwing ideologues thats a clear choice  cruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his rnc remarks were a swipe against trump adding that hes always been never hillary but not ever never trump he also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what ronald reagan said about gerald ford and what ted kennedy said about jimmy carter  my speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches cruz said both of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches one of the unfortunate things about the reaction is cleveland is that for many who were watching it was perceived that i was essentially embracing never trump i have never been a never trumper  after cruzs appearance beck said cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed trump he could have come on and said look guys heres the thing my supporters are yelling at me and i know that because so are mine he said my donors who are all in with the gop theyre all saying ill never fund  i wont fund you for the senate i wont fund you for the run in 2020 and i have to make a decision so the question is do i completely shut myself out of this game or do i play the game as much as i possibly can  authors

76k shares facebook twitter  hollywood legend clint eastwood endorsed republican presidential nominee donald trump while also expressing his lack of excitement for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton he is after all a well known hollywood conservative which is hard to come by  the actor said donald trump is  on to something because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness kissing up thats the kissass generation were in right now were really in a py generation everybodys walking on eggshells we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff  he went on  when i grew up those things werent called racist he continued and then when i did gran torino even my associate said this is a really good script but its politically incorrect and i said good let me read it tonight the next morning i came in and i threw it on his desk and i said were starting this immediately  well tell us how you really feel clint it appears that perhaps if even in the least bit that clint eastwood and donald trump have something in common they certainly have no filter eastwood did say in his statement that he believes donald trump occasionally steps out of line specifically trumps comments about a mexican judge being unfit to do his job because trump made derogatory comments about mexicans and he felt the judge would be prejudiced as a result but he brushes it off as saying that trump is simply stating what is on his mind  the icon himself gave some advice for the future that he thinks could potentially make a difference  id say get to work and start being more understanding of everybodyinstead of calling everybody names start being more understanding but get in there and get it done kick ass and take names and this may be my dad talking but dont spend what you dont have thats why were in the position we are in right now thats why people are saying why should i work ill get something for nothing maybe  he has made headlines over some of his comments about the republican nominee when people called donald trump racist he proclaimed that people just needed to get over it already he made sure to add a curse word in their for effect one of his biggest criticisms of hillary clinton is her willingness to remain in the status quo which he detests which honestly is not entirely inaccurate  eastwoods political sentiments are contrasted by the majority of hollywood hollywood is known for being made up predominantly of progressive liberals you cannot find an actor who is unwilling to use their status power fame and money to advance their liberal agenda and causes eastwood is one of the few a list celebrities who is conservative most others are barely known and dont do tell well after expressing their conservative sentiments just look at mel gibson and stacey dash  it is always nice to hear an a lister speak their conservative opinions because they are one of the hollywood elite thus they cannot be scoffed at as easily and dismissed certainly not the man the myth the legend clint eastwood
212k shares share this story  while the media was busy talking about the nyc bombings and the arrest of ahmad khan rahami there was another bomb threat in houston texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention la times reporter matt pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start and took to twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the nyc bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved  according to a news release from us attorney kenneth magidson houston man cary lee ogborn was arrested last friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting houston texas the statement from the us attorney specified that cary lee ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill injure or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building he was arrested late friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives  although ogborns plan to attack houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy matt pearces tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable newsworthy formula usually including islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality  despite the highprofile coverage of several attacks committed by islamic terrorists the numbers just do not reflect this narrative research from gallup and the triangle center on homeland and security found that law enforcement agencies in the united states consider antigovernment violent extremists not radicalized muslims to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face due to the fact that muslimamerican terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 911 represent just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the united states each year  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

analysis  kanye west and how hiphop tackles mental health  its not totally clear whats going on with kanye west the rapper who was filmed delivering onstage rants during recent shows in california on monday canceled the remaining 21 dates in his saint pablo tour hours later he was reportedly hospitalized for stress and exhaustion  west spent the night at ronald reagan ucla medical center for his own safety the associated press reported police without confirming the patient as west told ap that the officers arrived at a west hollywood home for a disturbance and an ambulance took the patient to the hospital to be placed on a psychiatric hold  before his hospitalization wests public breakdowns and streamofconsciousness speeches have been the subject of jokes and disdain but recent reports about wests wellbeing have reopened a conversation about mental health fame and hiphop  the genre has long been characterized by notions of hypermasculinity that allow little room for vulnerability and of black and brown men putting forward a tough adversarial persona but hiphop has always had introspective moments geto boys rapped my mind is playing tricks on me in 1991 in recent years weve seen more artists opening up about their emotional and mental struggles in the public eye and on albums  eminem followed his 2009 album relapse with one called recovery after experiencing addiction and depression dmx has rapped and spoken about suffering from bipolar disorder in october kid cudi publicly announced on his facebook page that he checked himself into rehabilitation for his depression and suicidal urges writing anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as i can remember and i never leave the house because of it  this followed angry tweets directed at drake and west  after it became public knowledge that kid cudi had checked into rehab drake released a song with lyrics dissing the rapper and his mental wellbeing and despite the backlash against drake online the toronto rapper doubled down  but much of the response to kid cudi was positive a hashtag yougoodman gained momentum as a conversation around masculinity race and mental health took place on social media  on monday kid cudi posted a list of celebrities artists and fans who actively supported him including west thank you for opening your hearts and extending your love and support during a troubling time he wrote  kendrick lamar has also written and spoken about depression and the emotional tumult of being on a world tour while his best friends back home were gunned down much of his album to pimp a butterfly centers on survivors guilt  the sound and the fury of kendrick lamar at the kennedy center  his lyrics were used for a kaiser permanente ad about depression after a 2015 concert lamar saw a woman crying and murmuring you saved my life she told him she was going to kill herself a year ago but his music helped her through  pharoahe monch a beloved independent artist has been open about dealing with depression which he has said in interviews was induced by a combination of medications he was taking following hospitalization for his asthma  at that time it wasnt really like it was now where you have people talking about issues readily in the public he said in a 2014 interview years ago it was just yo you bugging just deal with it  in another interview he told msnbc host melissa harrisperry that it was important for his 2014 album ptsd to include frank and vulnerable lyrics about his struggles and the stigma of depression within the black community  growing up in the community you look at mental issues as were strong and my parents were hardworking  its something thats looked at as a weakness so you kind of push through it sometimes without even realizing what the issue might be  in losing my mind pharoahe monch raps my family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental healthit was more or less an issue for white families with wealth  he continues void i defected employed self annoyedwent independent enjoyed stealthnow doctors prescribed sedatives and prozac  wests lyrics particularly on life of pablo have caused alarm among some who speculate theres more to them than bombastic exaggeration for instance on fml he raps about nothing being crazier than when he off his lexapro  but west is not just a hiphop artist he is a megastar aside from music he works in the fashion industry and is married to one of the most famous women in the world one who has built her career off documenting every aspect of her life wests tweets generate trending hashtags and breathless media coverage  what kanye west said at the vmas annotated full transcript  his public behavior over the years has fueled rumors among the public and garnered genuine concern from fans and those close to him much of this began after his mothers 2007 death he has gone on twitter rants given rambling interviews and stormed awardshow stages  most famously in 2009 when he interrupted taylor swifts mtv video music award acceptance speech turning him into a pariah and punchline  rhymefest who has cowritten west tracks for years announced in february that he had stopped collaborating with the chicago artist a month earlier after his work on life of pablo was complete his mind and spirit isnt right rhymefest tweeted he also tweeted i love my brother i pray for his health not our entertainment  last week west brought a sacramento concert to a halt with an onstage speech that went after among other things jay z beyoncé hillary clinton mtv and facebook when the news of his hospitalization broke monday night celebrities and artists immediately offered words of support  i want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother kanye west chance the rapper a west collaborator said in the middle of a performance on bbc radio 1 i want to just extend this prayer and extend this love from all the way in britain we might come back early to come see this man

ap photo backtalk robert kennedy would have hated donald trump the gop candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be  writing as a former legislative assistant to senator robert f kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of hillary clinton for president i was disappointed to see in politico the screed written by my former colleague adam walinsky excoriating clintons record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that donald trump should therefore be elected president it is one thing to disagree with secretary clinton which walinsky does heatedly and quite another to turn to donald trump  we should be clear that walinskys critique is not confined to clinton he lays out and massively overstates a dark view not just of clinton but also of president obama and almost the entire democratic party the analysis is overwrought but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is trump  story continued below  the question is not whether there is a militaryindustrial complex in our country president eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it the 21st century version begins with the iraq war which was originated by a republican president i am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that presidents obama clinton and carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways the question here is whether donald trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot  walinsky finds in trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with nato and other allies at another he will lash out at any perceived insult to the us or to himself and pledges that americas pride needs to be vindicated militarily america first trump says regularly bringing the isolationism of charles lindbergh to mindbefore excoriating president obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the islamic state  to compare john f kennedy and robert f kennedy to donald trump iswell i wont finish the sentence yes robert kennedy turned against the vietnam war but not because he felt that america should retreat from the world he opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of american interests the result as we know was the death of vietnamese and americans and others who should not have died jfk and rfk were internationalists they understood that world war ii left the united states with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world they understood that america must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world they understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk they made those difficult often excruciating decisions carefully and as transparently as possible never rashly impulsively or vindictively  walinsky quotes robert kennedys statement that if any member of the excomm other than john f kennedy had been president during the cuban missile crisis we would have had a nuclear war ask yourself what a president trump might have done in that moment restraint is not the word that comes to mind  this is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the united states should have seized iraqs oil resources as spoils to the victor  yes we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors but electing donald trump is not the answer it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways the answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither american security interests nor egregious human rights violationsa topic in which donald trump has shown an ostentatious indifference as his fondness for vladimir putin reflects  all the evidence provided again and again by donald trumps own mouth tells us not that he is a man of peace but that he is a man of no principlea man who will say and possibly do whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute he is like the weather in new england if you dont like it wait a minute we do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes we do not know what he knows because from all we can see he does not know much  even if walinskys diatribe is correct which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth there is nothing in it that justifies turning to donald trump of all occasions to break ranks with the democratic party this is the most inappropriate of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of john and robert kennedy two of our greatest public servants this is the most egregious i have ever seen  to say that i am disappointed by what walinsky has done is an understatement america in this election faces an existential questionand history will judge us by our answer walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle  peter edelman is the carmack waterhouse professor of law and public policy at georgetown university law center

there is a moment at every donald trump rally when donald trump marvels at the crazy spectacle hes created is there any place in america as fun as a donald trump rally he asks with a mischievous pursedlip grin the moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming trump trump trump thats the fun part the joint release of pentup fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect americans when you experience it in person you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and mexicans and muslims taking over their country gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying merry christmas  donald trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues a chainsaw artist named chris cox the founder of bikers 4 trump told me at a recent pensacola rally  story continued below  when trump fans are asked about his appeal the first thing they usually say is that he isnt a normal politician and his rambling fearmongering namecalling public speeches no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter do not feel like normal political events they feel like wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art they feel like revival meetings for the donald j trump church of cultural resentment with ritual denunciations of crooked hillary clinton barack obamawe call him president obama because we have to treat him with respect rightand other enemies of the congregation at a time when americans say theyre tired of politics as usual trump offers politics as deeply often disturbingly always unapologetically unusual  his opponent does not clintons events feel exactly like normal political events she may be the worlds most famous and polarizing woman but shes running an almost generic democratic campaign politics as very usual  tonight hillary clinton will take on donald trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories policy agendas and bases of support but their contrasting records and ideas havent been the defining divides of this strange political year what 2016 is really about is conventional versus not and no matter what happens tonight when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events youre constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is trump he is violating all the rules of the political gamerules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decencyand when 2016 is over its not clear whether those rules will still apply  whatever you think of clinton she tends to observe politesociety political traditions which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone whos attended a modern campaign stop the backdrops are decorated with redwhiteandblue bunting and talkingpoint slogans like love trumps hate or stronger together the small venues are selected to target niche groupsmillennials last week at temple university in philadelphia the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in orlandoand the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises the speeches are standard campaign fare dotted with wonky statistics and realperson anecdotes to buttress wellresearched policy proposals the candidate as she has for nearly four decades in public life sticks to her prepared text her audiences are supportive though not particularly emotive  i thought it was very substantial very specific glenn mccoy an adult educator at a catholic church who wore a hil yes pin to clintons speech about supporting disabled workers in orlando the purpose wasnt to whip the crowd into a frenzy were not looking to choose a president based on emotion  clinton had better hope not theres electricity at trump rallies that hers cant match its no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the trump shows live his crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies like nascar fans waiting for wrecks and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media the jobstealing chinese the pc sensitivity snobs who think youre prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and islamic terrorists out of the country its entertaining to watch him violate norms declaring clinton lacks the stamina to be president suggesting her security detail ought to disarm warning the election will probably be rigged he flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate the savagery of inner cities even the temperature at his rallies its 100 degrees in here and thats considered cool for an auditorium he casually drops one outlandish bombshellthe federal reserve is corrupt the fbi is covering up for clinton nafta was the worst deal in the history of the worldthen moves onto another before the last fully explodes  clinton doesnt do that whatever one thinks about her email protocols or benghazi or her penchant for secrecy she campaigns like a typical candidate she has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public her problem is that trumps unique combination of insult comedy and monstertruck rally despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace is exposing the focusgrouped stagemanaged paintbynumbers nature of typical candidacies clinton isnt getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic  nobody understands that better than the political savant named donald j trump he tells a lot of straightfaced falsehoods about clintons campaign like his accusations that its policyfree when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals and when trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop but theres something to his caricature of clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear at a rally in miami he did a sly imitation of clintons speecheshe claimed with faux specificity that theyre only 18 minutes when theyre usually twice that longwith a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in  bom bom bom see ya trump smirked see ya im going home  many americans really do seem sick of bombombomseeya politics but the live experience of trumps sayanything middlefinger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions hes shredding every day    before attending a recent trump rally in pensacola i watched a video of his last rally there during the republican primary in january at the time the news from the event had been his imjustsaying speculation that questions about ted cruzs citizenship might be disqualifying but starting with the star spangled banner performed by a kids group that later sued trump for breach of contract the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet  trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the bad dishonest very bad people in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds a theme he revisited three more times he criticized a us soldier for using the word sir to address the iranians who briefly captured him he advised americans to take their money out of the stock market which he described as a big fat bubble and predicted a collapse that would be beautiful to watch he gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands i didnt put him there im not paying him he read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of syrian refugees called himself more militaristic than anyone in this room complained that common core education bureaucrats make 400000 a yearactually the presidents salaryand announced the american dream was dead oh he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled  whoever the hell brought this mic systemdont pay the son of a bitch he seethed dont pay em dont pay em you know i believe in paying but when somebody does a bad job like this stupid mic you shouldnt pay the bastard terrible you gotta be tough with your people because theyll pay they dont care so were not going to pay i guarantee im not paying for this mic  so i was ready for more theater of the bizarre when trump returned eight months later to pensacolas 12000seat arena which was once again packed to capacity vendors sold trump that bitch tshirts and trump 2016 confederate flags the pastor giving the invocation shouted tyranny has raised its ugly head our constitution is under attack the crowd started chanting lock her up before trump even appeared he then took the stage to a tremendous roar andwell to be honest he seemed a lot less provocative than i had expected  hes freeing up our speech said one trump supporter    we can talk about the muslim invasion we can be against amnesty maybe well be able to say merry christmas again  trump was now using a teleprompter which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in january and while he used it more as a guideline than a script it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staffwritten clichés and republican talking points about encrusted insiders and turning the page he said the kind of things regular politicians say the history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday and once again well have a government of by and for the people he even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him namechecking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base the crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowdduring one trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty a supporter in a redwhiteandblue trucker hat screamed what about white peoplebut the rally still felt at least quasinormal trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them like a 35 percent tax on imports and his mexicofinanced wallbut really who still thinks about them  afterwards though i saw a breaking story about an offhand comment trump had made warning that if iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at americans when he was president as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier their ships would be blown out of the water trump had essentially threatened to launch world war 3 and i hadnt noticed back at my hotel i checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused clinton of causing all the problems in the world including north korean nuclear tests that began under george w bush he had mused that personally i think shes an unstable person and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone right smack in the middle of the heartand she wouldnt be prosecuted ok he had denied cozying up to russian dictator vladimir putinand then he had cozied up again hes been nice to me and if hes nice to me thats fine if we got along with russia that wouldnt be so bad would it and at a time of low unemployment cheap gas and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades trump had flatly declared that the country is collapsing  those all would have been jawdropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate but the year of trump has desensitized many of us to his rapidfire transgressions were normalizing the unprecedented at a rally a few days later in asheville nc trump called the us military incredibly weak defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68yearold female protester and said the black communitywhich endured slavery and jim crowwas in the worst shape theyve ever been ever ever ever yet the main trump story from the associated press focused on how he had refrained from attacking clinton over her bout with pneumonia under the headline restraint on clinton health shows new campaign discipline predictably trump mocked clintons health problems later in the week suggesting she needed more sleep warning she didnt have enough energy to handle the rigors of the white house falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldnt make it through one  that sort of behavior just hasnt been seen on the presidential campaign trail but its that defiant youcanttellmewhatimsupposedtosay spirit that trump loyalists love hes not a politician nobody controls him a lot of us are tired of worrying about peoples feelings always watching our ps and qs so its cool to see him speak his mind said alan smith a 43yearold firefighter from nearby gulf breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension bill turpin a retired army veteran from brayton iowa told me at a trump rally outside des moines that while clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathinghe doesnt even believe the official story about her health because he fainted once and he didnt stumble around like she did on the videotrump is a businessman with nothing to fear hell call a spade a spade and if you dont like it you can shove it again and again trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness standing up for their right to primalscream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and black lives matter thugs  hes freeing up our speech said norris westfall an auto detailer who wore an infowars liberty or death tshirt to a recent trump rally in asheville nc we can talk about the muslim invasion we can be against amnesty without everyone saying were offensive maybe well be able to say merry christmas again  its fashionable to attribute the trump phenomenon to economic anxiety but the trump voters i interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety they seemed less anxious about the state of the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalition and they seemed less anxious than pissed offat a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper at thought leaders more worried about islamophobia than islamic terror at racial guilttrippers who demonize cops while ignoring blackonblack crime in asheville i watched an air force veteran named gary latham explode at some antitrump protesters who were chanting that they didnt want hate in their state lazy motherfuckers get a fucking job he explained to me that america was under siege with thousands of syrian refugees embedded in western carolina and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant americans clinton considered deplorable  the trump voters i interviewed seemed less anxious about the obama economy than the rise of the multicultural obama coalitionand they seemed less anxious than pissed off  one of the speakers before trump took the stage in asheville was a whitehaired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature she used the opportunity to proclaim we want our state rights back  were sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats says kim buckner a nursing assistant who wore a dont tread on me pin to the asheville rally trump is saying what were all thinking screw you call us deplorable all you want our rights dont end where your feelings begin  trump echoes those antiantiracism tropes describing accusations of racism as the oldest play in the democratic playbook and hes begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of innercity life arguing that its so hellish blacks might as well vote trump ill say it openly and some people dont like it i dont really care what do you have to lose his long riffs about how hell fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks cant walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to nonracist whites but in person they feel much more like creepy concerntrolling for the benefit of jeering trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals when trump claims that black youths dont get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percentthe real rate is about one third of thathes fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the whitesupremacy sites he retweets every now and then the trump supporters i interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting innercity blacks than criticizing their lifestyles bemoaning their dependence on government and blaming their president polls show that most trump supporters still think obama was born in kenyaand many i spoke to believe hes also a muslim who supports isis  one notable exception was richard cohen a jewish contractor who attended the rally in asheville cohen told me trump is pandering to racism antisemitism and fear of hispanics among his supporters he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier trump event after hearing spectators yell the nword but cohen supports trump anyway because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid fingerinthewind political establishment a lot of us who like him dont like the stuff he says about race cohen said obviously some do  this really isnt normal and while clinton is an unlikely poster child for normala first lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern a secretary of state who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreamsshe presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak  i remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a senate seat in new york even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office even though her husband was still in the white house after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation she simply ignored the weirdness of it all running as a standardissue democrat in a democratic state diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered and against a basically normal republican candidate it worked a majority of new yorkers agreed with her agenda and sent her to the senate to pursue it  in 2016 though clinton has struggled to make a case for normal shes tried to push a standardissue democratic agenda but in the year of trump the race hasnt been about standard anything    nearly one of every five americans lives with a disability and just about everyone else wishes them the best so clintons orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an inclusive economy to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium in the i4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state clinton spoke to 300 supportersa much smaller crowd than trump regularly attracts but far more diverseabout her goal of an america that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens she also laid out a fourpart plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled americans flourish in the economy just two months before election day the speech was designed to illustrate clintons concern about a worthy issue  it did that more or less afterwards her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose her depth of knowledge her willingness to listen nobody mentioned eloquence or flair but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show  i thought it was a nice speech lewis smith a retired mechanic in orlando told me afterwards not very exciting but i believe shell do what she says  the speech started slowly as clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters a few madefortv soundbites about the riots in charlotte and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone her speechwriters clearly cutandpasted in some of her standard lines about her middleclass origins her support for familyfriendly policies like paid leave and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from alzheimers disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators  the rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled americans who have been undervalued by society for too long it was a nice sentiment expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control across the country people with disabilities are running businesses teaching students caring for our loved ones theyre holding public office making breakthrough scientific discoveries reporting the news and creating art that inspires and challenges us maybe some disabled americans create uninspiring art but not in hillary clinton speeches in the united states of america the greatest country in the world we believe that everyone is created equal clinton said this kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value  clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled from her push for their right to attend school as a young childrens defense fund lawyer to her appointment of the state departments firstever advisor for disability rights she mentioned disabled people shes knownincluding the unbelievably goodlooking actor christopher reeve who told her that family values should mean that every family has valueand her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity she then detailed her plan which while infinitely more substantive than anything trump has ever said about disabilities was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses plus an elimination of the subminimum wage that is currently paid to some disabled workers  the audience responded with warmth if not exuberance but i must confess that after watching trump claim obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a really slow vicious death to exhaust them accuse the federal reserve and the justice department of corruption and tell his supporters he doesnt feel bad if theyre working harder than ever because he is too clintons scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull she gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic but it felt like a political speech a combination of virtue signaling and interestgroup outreach cable covered a trump rally instead and was rewarded when boxing promoter don king dropped an nbomb in his introduction there was nothing controversial or unpredictable in clintons remarks they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework and that unlike trump who talks mostly about himself she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team she didnt even mention trumps reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter because she wanted a more positive message that day she was careful to say nothing impolitic which is basically politics  geannie bastian a student with cerebral palsy said her political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter    believe me ive seen that gesture a lot but before it was always from children she said trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew  in fairness to clinton there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched the disabled and their families joe kilsheimer the mayor of a central florida suburb has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby but went on to become the first eagle scout with downs syndrome and lead a productive life what hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home kilsheimer said i know a lot of people dont trust her because they see her filtered through politics and media but shes got heart  geannie bastian a university of central florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair said she was moved by clintons message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential but she said her real political awakening came when trump made fun of that reporter whose hand looks quite similar to hers believe me ive seen that gesture a lot but before it was always from children she said trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew  political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm voters only get to vote once no matter how fired up they are but theyre less likely to turn out to vote if they arent fired up in any case even at her own events its a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of trump than it is to find avid clinton fans voters of color seem especially riled i repeatedly heard from black democrats offended by trumps crusade to deny that the first africanamerican president was american and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose my daughter has a doctorate her husband is an orthodontist weve got plenty to lose said betty edwards a retired educator in the orlando suburbs theres never been a candidate who thought so little of us  many hispanics are similarly energized by trumps calls for mass deportations and a wall sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country andy gutierrez a singer and puerto rican voting activist who brought a boricua vota sign to the orlando event says trump has been a oneman registration machine he thinks were all mexicans and were all bad gutierrez said people arent superexcited about hillary but trust me theyll come out to stop trump  clintons excitement problem is a real problem at her university event in philadelphia millennials who had swooned over bernie sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant shes ok i guess said thomas davidenko a freshman at temple my main worry is trumps fingers on the nuclear code but id say she knows what shes doing in orlando i met more actual clinton fans especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer but even her staunch supporters said theyre struggling to persuade friends lou smith a union celltower technician for att said many of his arabhating white colleagues at work think shes a typical lying politician so theyre voting for trumpand her bernieloving daughters think the same thing so theyre staying home  shes been around so long and republicans have thrown so much mud on her he said shes great on the issues but its hard to get people to focus on that  clinton is a policy wonk and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse she could have focused on taxes and health insurance climate change and diplomacy she might have framed the election as the democratic bottomup approach that produced prosperity during her husbands administration and recovery during obamas with the trickledown philosophy that ended in economic collapse under bush when bill clinton was in the chair everybody was doing great and then everything fell apart before obama fixed it said jeneka lloyd who owns a small painting business in orlando man hillary should talk about that  but trump is not a normal republican and 2016 hasnt focused on his policies because theyre so insubstantial and flexible because hes trashed bush as well as obama because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful fox news interviews or incendiary tweets and because his business record charity scams and racial provocations provide such a targetrich environment beyond the issues its a lot harder to persuade americans of the magical thinking behind trumps plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a gold star family looting his own charitable foundation refusing to release his tax returns and other unheardof behavior meanwhile the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern majorparty presidential nominee with the lone exception of donald trump  so clinton has ended up in the proverbial mudwrestling match with a pig theyve both gotten dirty and neither she nor the public has liked it    tonight on long island trump and clinton will meet in a very conventional setting and as usual no one really has any idea how trump will try to handle it which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television his team is already warning moderator lester holt not to factcheck the candidates which makes sense given trumps distant relationship with facts there will be rules governing the debate but trumps political brand is all about breaking the rules  what is clear is that trump will portray himself as the candidate of change which is exactly what he is he essentially wants to roll back the obama era repealing the presidents health care reforms wall street reforms and climate rules as well as the obama approach to the economy and the war on terror but trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the tv era upending every assumption about what is a gaffe what is disqualifying and what you just cant say if you want to sit in the oval office and represent an entire nation if he uses tonights debate to brag about his genitalia or invite the russians to hack his opponent well it wont be normal but it wont be the first time either  and yes even though shes unlikely to put it this way clinton represents the status quonot just a continuation of democratic policies but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics shes playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played and it wouldnt feel so stilted if her opponent hadnt started playing experimental honkytonk the question for 2016 is whether americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that theyll turn to the politics of trump that question will be decided not by the thousands of americans who flock to trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see clinton but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event  but the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual americans never liked it and trump has helped expose how cautious contrived and anodyne it can be but he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution restraint premeditated choreography and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning arent the most authentic elements of successful political leadership theyre part of it and while politics as usual does have some bogus kabuki theater qualities it also reflects some baseline valuesshowing basic respect to political opponents and people who arent like you staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequencesthat have constrained politicians in a good way its not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms trump has shattered back together and while we may not have liked them we might miss them when theyre gone not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted and trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future  michael grunwald is a senior staff writer for politico magazine

trump happy he didnt bring up bill clintons affairs  donald trump made his way into the spin room moments after the close of the debate and told reporters he was proud that he did not bring up former president bill clintons extramarital affairs  im very happy that i was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to bill clinton trump said to a gaggle of reporters because i have a lot of respect for chelsea clinton and i just didnt want to say what i was going to say  story continued below  and what exactly a reporter asked was that going to be  ill tell you maybe at the next debate well see he responded  a candidates presence in the spin room where surrogates and advisers typically pitch their take on the debate to reporters was unusual but trump with his wife melania at his side took a few questions  i think it went better than i ever thought he said of the debate i loved it i loved it  authors

21k shares facebook twitter  for the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across charlotte the riots are in response to the police shooting of keith lamont scott which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality scotts wife who filmed the shooting told police that he wasnt armed and was only carrying a book  as usual the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit there was in fact a gun recovered at the scene and there was a holster on scotts leg spotted in the police dashcam footage those citing this as yet another proof that police are racist should know that the officer who shot scott was black himself so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting  as it turns out scott has a history of violence and theres no reason to think he wouldnt have used his firearm if he had the chance as bearing arms reported  rakeyia scotts cry to cmpd officers that her husband keith lamont scott did not own a guneven as he brandished a gun in front of themnow appears to be a calculated lie according to rakeyia scott on oct 5 a gaston county district court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order the court order told scott not to go near his wife three of their children and the childrens schools he was not allowed near their gastonia apartment theyd called home since april 2014 according to court documents he was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally eleven days later rakeyia scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband writing he is no longer a threat to me and my family but three days before she got the order keith scott had kicked her punched their 8yearold in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun she had written he said he is a killer and we should know that she wrote she said the man shed been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon having been incarcerated from april 2004 to april 2011 she checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before  the scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by scott left him a changed man and yet he was still an armed felon brandishing a gun if not threatening with her at this time yeah  ok  scotts wife told officers he didnt own a firearm during the altercation which was clearly a lie and one that couldve gotten them killed while rioters destroy charlotte theyre doing so over a man who couldve killed those officers and had a wife that he himself once threatened wouldve been an accomplice to their murders

donald trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests he is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate  but lately as trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel he has also been in something of a retreat that is trump is only talking to fox news right now  trump is saying yes to fox news almost every day but saying no to most other major networks and news organizations  a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee he called into fox  friends on monday morning he is booked on the oreilly factor monday night and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump if nothing else it limits the candidates exposure to hardhitting questions  while fueling frustration among journalists  at fox news trump can avoid pesky followup questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy long after he claims to have dropped it fox news hosts wont ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement at fox news trump isnt challenged  and thats the way he wants it  the problem is wrapping up in the fox news cocoon may feel good for the time being but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort trump isnt reaching out  it is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign where instead of following the model of successful politicians like george w bush and president obama by holding campaign rallies in swing districts hoping to persuade voters trump has rallies with the converted  on election day in 2012 fox news viewers were shocked to find the romney landslide the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality they may be setting themselves up for a major failure  featured image via flickr

sen chuck schumers money could give democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in florida and ohio  getty schumer transfers millions to dems in bid for senate takeover  chuck schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash and now hes starting to dole it out to fellow democrats who might make him majority leader  the new york senator is transferring 1 million to the senate democrats campaign arm on tuesday hes also given 32 million to state parties over the past week democratic sources said  story continued below  earlier this month schumer shifted an additional 2 million from his campaign war chest to the democratic senatorial campaign committee altogether in september schumer has transferred 62 million of the 27 million he has on hand to help democratic hopefuls  republicans control 54 seats but democrats are favored to win three back so control of the chamber is seen as a tossup as the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut a significant transfer from schumer could go a long way  the kochs do not have a finite amount of money they have unlimited money we have a finite amount of money said senate minority leader harry reid dnev in an interview on monday were just trying to allocate our resources so theyre meaningful to us and our candidates  schumers money could give democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in florida and ohio and eye instead cheaper races in north carolina and missouri no one has more to gain from a democratic takeover of the senate than schumer who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as reid retires after a 12year stint as party head  schumers donation is both a vote of confidence in his partys candidates and a reflection of democrats future challenges democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight gop seats so if democrats come up short in november they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade  schumer has also raised 2 million directly for candidates committees and a joint account that he leads has collected 800000 combined for the dscc and individual candidates hes planning a fall event in new york to benefit senate candidates thats projected to bring in upwards of another million according to a person close to the new york senator  schumer has been relentless said a dscc official  schumer and reid have also appeared at numerous events for senate majority pac a super pac backing democratic senate hopefuls run by former aides to reid including his onetime chief of staff susan mccue the group which can accept unlimited donations from donors has spent more than 30 million this cycle democrats complain that republican super pacs have far outspent them  leader reid and senator schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money republicans are pouring into senate races through independent expenditures the amounts are staggering mccue said in a statement  schumer still will have roughly 20 million on hand after the transfer he is up for reelection in new york with the latest polls showing him trouncing his gop challenger by more than 40 points however if past is prologue schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition  schumer spent about 13 million in 2010 but that was a historically bad year for democrats schumers colleagues wont rule out the possibility that hell donate more to his partys senate takeover effort  if he thinks it will make a difference hell do it hes very calculating said a democratic senator chuck will be there if you need him  sen debbie stabenow dmich a close ally of schumer agreed that the presumptive democratic leader might provide more  hes going to watch everything closely its my sense hes 1000 percent committed to taking back the senate stabenow said  theres no decision yet on where the dscc might allocate the additional money from schumer it could go toward races in new hampshire pennsylvania or nevada states that are all exceedingly close or help compete in pricey florida using the cash in redleaning states is another option  were going to make some tough decisions which havent been made yet reid said  the national republican senatorial committee has been outraised by the dscc to the tune of 36 million outside groups like the senate leadership fund are making up the difference but republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers with mcconnell coming up with nearly 4 million in transfers thus far sen john thune rsd made a big splash with a 2 million transfer but even though he has millions more on hand thune said hell need to hang on to the rest of his cash  i dont think i can probably keep pace with schumer thune said in an interview  republicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members after sen richard shelby of alabama spurned transferring any of his 10 million now the gop hopes that nrsc vice chairs dean heller of nevada and tom cotton of arkansas may make a lastminute transfer they have yet to give money directly to the group gop sources said though they have helped raise funds directly for the nrsc the third vice chair joni ernst of iowa gave last week an aide said tuesday morning  republicans however simply dont have their own chuck schumer instead they are relying on a tightening presidential race deeppocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of trump to eke out a win  hes a machine senate majority whip john cornyn of texas said of schumer his workout partner but it may not make a difference the texan added    authors

school choice fails to make a difference  this is the kind of news that schoolchoice advocates and skeptics alike need to pay attention to the economist magazine reports that a team of academic economists found that students who won a lottery in louisiana to receive vouchers to go to the public or private school of their choice did worse than students who didnt win the lottery  this outcome flies in the face of the predictions of many economists who often tout school choice as a way to improve the us educational system while also increasing equality of opportunity economists typically assume that people are rational and wellinformed and will make decisions that benefit them if giving students and their parents more school choice hurts the students academically then something is seriously wrong with the theory

cnn north korea went on the offensive friday blasting the us for aggression in asia blaming washington for its pursuit of nuclear weapons and threatening the us with tremendous consequences beyond imagination  the democratic peoples republic of korea had no other choice but to go nuclear foreign minister ri yong ho told the un general assembly to defend itself from the constant nuclear threats from the united states  ris comments came as the us and asian nations gathered in new york friday with a fresh reminder of what they consider the gravest threat facing the region north koreas announcement this week that it had successfully tested its most powerful rocket engine yet  the test tuesday was followed by a us show of force as the pentagon on wednesday flew two b1b bombers alongside the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea setting the the stage for ussouth korea joint military exercises in october that will include a simulated nuclear facility strike  the heightened tensions north koreas steady drumbeat of tests and its nuclear ambitions have put the region on edge and the pentagon on notice  north koreas unpredictable behavior and capability development also continues to threaten allies and potentially the homeland gen joseph dunford chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said wednesday in maryland its consumed an awful lot of time  i think its fair to say  of senior leaderships time over the past few weeks  the north korean minister offered a throughthelooking glass version of the same events only a couple of days ago the united states has again threatened the dprk by flying the strategic bombers b1b over the military demarcation line on the korean peninsula and landing in south korea ri said we will never remain onlookers at it and the united states will have to face tremendous consequences beyond imagination  meanwhile secretary of state john kerry met friday on the sidelines of the un general assembly with foreign ministers from the association of southeast asian nations a 10member bloc dedicated to economic political and security cooperation  the united states will do whatever is necessary to defend our own citizens and to honor our security commitments to our allies kerry told the asean meeting  he called on allies to vigorously enforce sanctions against the isolated regime and urged asean members to ensure that the dprk pays a price for its dangerous actions  japanese prime minister shinzo abe made a blunt call for international action at the un wednesday right before our eyes north korea is carrying out a plan about which there can be no doubt abe said there is no alternative but to say that the threat has now reached a dimension altogether different from what has transpired until now  the perceived threat is changing regional dynamics bringing old rivals japan and south korea closer together its putting china on the spot as washington pushes beijing to do more to rein its ally in even as tensions over the south china sea complicate cooperation and it will likely prompt a new international push for tougher sanctions the likes of which were used to force iran to the negotiating table  thats still unlikely to stop north korea formally known as the democratic peoples republic of korea experts said indeed us officials and scientific experts expect another nuclear test as soon as early october  from north koreas perspective it only makes sense to continue these tests and continue to develop these weapons until theres a substantial shift in dialogue with the us said alison evans a country risk senior analyst at the global consulting firm ihs  for north korea its the recognition thats the important thing it needs its status as a nuclear power to be recognized evans said adding that the leadership sees developing a nuclear deterrent as a guarantor of survival  us officials say the pentagon is watching carefully for another nuclear test meanwhile the union of concerned scientists said there is some speculation that pyongyang may try another satellite launch around october 10 the anniversary of the founding of its workers party of korea  north korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in january in the ensuing months it has followed that detonation with a total of 21 ballistic missile tests including land and submarinebased launches  in may north koreas 32yearold leader kim jongun made the countrys ambitions official announcing that pyongyang was on a dual track of developing nuclear weapons and the economy  just watched us b1 bombers fly over south korea replay more videos  must watch us b1 bombers fly over south korea 0252  pyongyang then staged its largest nuclear test yet on september 9 the anniversary of the dprks founding in 1948  and tuesdays rocket launch was substantially larger and more powerful than anything north korea has tested before according to 38 north a program devoted to analyzing north korea at johns hopkins universitys school of advanced international studies  all this testing is unlikely to win it the us recognition it craves though  after the more recent nuclear test president barack obama made clear that the united states does not and never will accept north korea as a nuclear state  obama said that the us would work with asian allies the un security council and international partners to implement existing measures and take additional significant steps including new sanctions to demonstrate to north korea that there are consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions  however the rhetoric from the presidential campaign trail is a constant reminder that obama administration will soon no longer calling the american shots on the issue  republican presidential nominee donald trump has held out the possibility of meeting with kim in a dramatic break with us political conventions he earned criticism for the remark as well as for suggesting that south korea and japan should consider developing their own nuclear weapons  at some point we have to say you know what were better off if japan protects itself against this maniac in north korea trump told anderson cooper at a cnn town hall in milwaukee in march were better off frankly if south korea is going to start to protect itself  the statements have rattled tokyo and seoul and while trump has said that china must play a stronger role in checking their neighbor and ally his promise to play tough with beijing on trade could also roil that effort  the republican candidates tough talk has only heightened the uncertainty surrounding american policy in the region and is likely to be something that us officials are asked to address in their consultations friday  photos south korea us hold largest ever drills

north korea specifically she has emphasized ratcheting up us sanctions  international sanctions levied in march after the january nuclear test were the first on north korea to do more than target weapons development or luxury goods for the elite they ban all weapons trade and require inspections of all cargo to and from the country among other steps  the international community could squeeze north korea further by targeting the export of its resources said bruce klingner a senior research fellow at the heritage foundation echoing the way un sanctions targeted iran by banning the export of

nate smith executive director of the texas nationalist movement looked uncertain as a man identifying himself as an east ukrainian resistance fighter pledged solidarity to smiths struggle for an independent texas standing in a conference room in the ritz hotel in central moscow on sunday smith nodded noncommittally and handed over his business card  it wasnt the only incongruous encounter taking place at the ritz at what has been dubbed moscows international conference of separatists an eclectic kremlinfunded gathering of organizations and sometimes wacky individuals pressing for selfrule for often unlikely territories  amidst the heavy glitz of the hotel catalonian separatists and dissident irish republicans listened politely to presentations from east ukrainian rebels azerbaijani minorities and the thoughts of the selfproclaimed king of hawaii who called in via video link  and among the few dozen activists comparing ideas for how to achieve selfdetermination were two americans campaigning for texan and californian secession from the united states  the conference now in its second year is funded largely by the kremlin and organized by the antiglobalization movement of russia a group that closely follows government positions the movement says it is unconnected to the kremlin but the hotel conference was almost entirely paid for by a charitable fund founded by president vladimir putin which provided close to 546000 for the project according to public records the attendees including the texan delegate had been offered free flights and accommodation  the conferences organizers present it as a platform for marginalized groups but its agenda overlaps with kremlin efforts to promote russia as an alternative guardian for global order at the head of democratic movement opposed to alleged american imperialism  our main goal is to create a multipolar world the conferences creator aleksander v ionov told its participants our president vladimir vladimirovich putin is probably the main antiglobalist in the world  ionov himself a relatively littleknown businessman has repeatedly met syrian president bashar alassad whom russia is backing militarily saying the two discussed humanitarian aid and media activities two weeks ago  ionovs conference plays into moscows own longtime policy of backing separatists in its former soviet neighbors while jailing and harassing separatist groups at home moscow has leveraged them abroad a pretext for military intervention most recently fomenting the violent secessionist conflict in eastern ukraine a sizable presence of prorussian rebel supporters was visible on sunday while not a single russian separatist group took part  all that and the antiamerican flavor sometimes made uncomfortable listening for the groups less used to the atmosphere in the kremlins orbit  its kind of awkward i guess smith said after one 30minute denunciation of american inequity  abc news  smiths group the texas nationalist movement is campaigning for a referendum on whether texas should exit the united states founded over 10 years ago the group attracted some attention recently when it came within two votes of forcing the texas state gop to bring a debate on a secession referendum to the floor of the republican convention smith said he was grateful for the chance to promote his campaign and was eager to clarify his attendance did not mean he was aligning with the kremlin  were here to have a dialogue were not in agreement with all the groups that are here smith said were here for very specific reasons we came here to make a statement on behalf of the people of texas  it was a sentiment echoed by louis j marinelli from the yes california independence campaign there to get his message out about his plan to make the golden state a nation  we want to draw attention to our campaign marinelli said were not signing an alliance with russia or anything like that  the two secessionists urge for independence stems largely from a distaste with american foreign policy and a sense the us has become dysfunctional a gentlemannered it consultant married to a russian marinelli is aiming for a secession referendum by 2019  the us government is so dysfunctional it cant be repaired from within anymore and if we were a separate nation running our own affairs we could improve the quality of life for californians marinelli said  both men were hoping for a donald trump victory in the us presidential elections banking on a surge in people looking to detach themselves from america the uks recent brexit vote to leave the european union had also heartened many attendees  but why exactly the kremlin had decided to pay to gather them in moscow few among the foreign attendees could say nor did they appear particularly interested  im not here to make presumptions about potential reasons for this conference smith said  however the conference  and its location in one of moscows expensive hotels within shouting distance of the kremlin walls  slots into a recognizable recent russian strategy russia has been backing far right political parties in the west in particular reportedly funding frances antieuropean union party the front national with a 10 million loan the practice echoes that of the soviet union which secretly supported radical fringe groups around the world but now coupled with elaborate disinformation campaigns from state media outlets  its a schoolbook case said peter kreko a fulbright visiting professor at indiana university who has studied russias use of the far right the simple reason is that russia is interested in dividing the western world the strategy is not to create new divisions but to take the most from divisions already there  kreko said the idea was to back groups hindering european integration and to undermine faith in westernstyle liberal democracy  the toolkit is pretty much the same as in the soviet union any kind of movements that can cause chaos kreko said adding he thought the conference was also a prop for domestic propaganda that state media would use to paint russia as a champion of democracy  few of the conference attendees were concerned they might become kremlin pawns seeing it simply as a way to get their message out  everybodys using everybody marinelli said were using this conference for our own purposes we want the attention so that we can get the word out they want  he trailed off before finishing everybodys got their own agenda right so thats just the way it is  for most of the attendees the main pull appeared to be the guaranteed presence of the media attracted by the conferences oddity  ive talked to seven media organizations today ive got to get my story out said diarmuid mac dubhglais international secretary for republican sinn féin a tiny irish republican splinter group that supports the violent removal of british control over northern ireland  in any case mac dubhglais said he wouldnt let vladimir himself impose ideas on him  im not going to start passing out propaganda when i go home and start marching sovietstyle he said  besides he said perhaps the russian motive was altruistic maybe in fairness they might think the cause is just he said then paused before adding im hoping thats what they think

why cant jessie j be bi  singer jessie j 24 is in the news because of her sexuality again but this time its not because of something the out and outspoken bi artist has done just the opposite this time its because of something an unofficial biographer says she hasnt done and that thing is have sex with men  chloe govan says that jessie j is not bisexual  even though she herself identifies that way  but is in fact a lesbian the proof according to the biographer is the fact that she hasnt dated men since she was 17 thats seven whole years of being only with women but im confused does bisexuality come with an expiration date  here are some facts that govan may not be aware of  according to research from the williams institute the leading lgbt demographic research organization in the world there are twice as many women who identify as bisexual as there are women who identify as lesbian that means among women date women the odds are two to one that a woman is out as bi  according to lesbian professor dr lisa diamond one of the leading scholars on womens sexuality lesbian and bisexual women more often have fluid complex varied sexual histories than linear static ones bisexual women  and lesbians  may be 5050 in terms of experiences with men and women they may have long periods of time being with just one gender and they may even be lifelong monogamists who are only ever with one person of one gender all of that can fall under the umbrella of women who use the word bisexual to describe themselves  and according to lesbian professor dr paula rust the vast majority of lesbians have had sex with men both before and after coming out as lesbians  in fact in the lesbian community its so widely known that most lesbians sleep with men that theres even a term for the very few who dont goldstar a goldstar lesbian is a lesbian who has never been with a man  so if lesbians can  and do  sleep with men and still call themselves lesbians then why cant a bisexual woman not sleep with men and still call herself bi  if women who identify as bisexual can have enormous variety in their sexual histories why cant jessie j be bi  and if there are twice as many bi women as lesbians why cant jessie j be bi  research from the williams institute also shows that bisexuals tend to be younger than lesbians jessie j is 24 years old why cant she be bi  govan says that jessie j was forced to say shes bi by music executives even though shes really a lesbian because bisexuality would be more appealing to her audience but according to dr gregory herek the leading researcher on stigma bisexual women are much more stigmatized than lesbians  research also shows that bisexual women are more likely than lesbians  and straight women  to be victims of domestic violence this means that bisexual women are considered less appealing and are more attacked all of which is extremely disturbing and has been the subject of much of my other writing my point is this bisexuality will draw a bigger audience trope is bullshit  one of jessie js most famous songs is called do it like a dude around the internet this song is getting bandied about as further proof that shes a lesbian but first of all why cant bisexual women be masculine too and why must lesbians always be some of the most masculine women i know are bi and some of the most feminine ones i know are lesbians  second of all when you read the lyrics you see that its actually a song about a butch woman at a bar who turns on men by being her masculine self the lyrics say boom boom pour me a beer no pretty drinks im a guy out here and later boys come say what you wanna boys gettin hot under the collar why cant that bi in fact how is it not bi  and finally why cant jessie j be bi just because she says she is why is it that when a celebrity comes out as a lesbian i dont read that shes actually really secretly bi but was pressured by her handlers to say shes gay but when someone comes out as bi i see this kind of thing over and over again why is female bisexuality so unbelievable to people and why must a womans statement about her own bisexuality be discredited how hard is it to just take a womans word for it when she talks about her bisexuality  why cant jessie j be bi

by republican leaders trump issued a short video statement saying i said it i was wrong and i apologize but he also called the revelation a distraction from the issues we are facing today he said that his foolish words are much different than the words and actions of bill clinton whom he accused of abusing women and hillary clinton whom he accused of having bullied attacked shamed and intimidated his victims  ive never said im a perfect person nor pretended to be someone that im not ive said and done things i regret and the words released today on this more than a decadeold video are one of them anyone who knows me knows these words dont reflect who i am trump said  in an apparent response to republican critics asking him to drop out of the race he said we will discuss this more in the coming days see you at the debate on sunday  the tape includes audio of bush and trump talking inside the bus as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment  in that audio trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman whose full name is not given in the video  i moved on her and i failed ill admit it trump is heard saying it was unclear when the events he was describing took place the tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife melania  i did try and f her she was married trump says  trump continues and i moved on her very heavily in fact i took her out furniture shopping she wanted to get some furniture i said ill show you where they have some nice furniture  i moved on her like a bitch but i couldnt get there and she was married trump says then all of a sudden i see her shes now got the big phony tits and everything shes totally changed her look  at that point in the audio trump and bush appear to notice arianne zucker the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soapopera set  your girls hot as s in the purple says bush whos now a cohost of nbcs today show  ive got to use some tic tacs just in case i start kissing her trump says you know im automatically attracted to beautiful  i just start kissing them its like a magnet just kiss i dont even wait  and when youre a star they let you do it trump says you can do anything  whatever you want says another voice apparently bushs  grab them by the py trump says you can do anything  in wake of debate multiple women accuse trump of sexual advances  a spokeswoman for nbc universal which produces and distributes access hollywood declined to comment  this was lockerroom banter a private conversation that took place many years ago bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course  not even close trump said in a statement i apologize if anyone was offended  billy bush in a statement released by nbc universal said obviously im embarrassed and ashamed its no excuse but this happened eleven years ago  i was younger less mature and acted foolishly in playing along im very sorry  after the video appeared online friday afternoon democratic nominee hillary clinton wrote on twitter this is horrific we cannot allow this man to become president her running mate sen tim kaine va told reporters it makes me sick to my stomach while campaigning in las vegas  planned parenthood action fund which has endorsed clinton issued a statement from executive vice president dawn laguens saying what trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault  trump was also criticized by members of his own party house speaker paul d ryan who said he is sickened by trumps comments said the republican presidential candidate will no longer appear with him at a campaign event in wisconsin on saturday  women are to be championed and revered not objectified i hope mr trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests ryan said in a statement  in a short statement issued moments after ryans trump said his running mate indiana gov mike pence will be representing me at the wisconsin event  sen kelly ayotte nh who is running for reelection and has said she will vote for trump called his comments totally inappropriate and offensive  republican national committee chairman reince priebus who has stood by trump uncritically through numerous controversies said in a statement no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner ever  former presidential candidate mitt romney a trump critic said in a statement hitting on married women condoning assault such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt americas face to the world  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky said the comments are repugnant and unacceptable in any circumstance and made clear trumps brief statement would not suffice  as the father of three daughters i strongly believe that trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape he said late friday  one of trumps most prominent socialconservative supporters tony perkins of the family research council told buzzfeeds rosie gray my personal support for donald trump has never been based upon shared values  trumps running mate pence was at a diner in toledo when the news broke  about to view the diners collection of signed cardboard hotdog buns which includes one signed by trump but the reporters traveling with pence were quickly ushered out of the diner by campaign staff before they could ask trumps running mate about it according to politico politico reported that the journalists traveling in pences protective pool were not permitted to film pence as he left the diner  the tape appears at a time when trump the republican presidential nominee has sought to make a campaign issue out of his opponents marriage trump has criticized former president bill clinton for his past infidelity and criticized opponent hillary clinton as her husbands enabler  hillary clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics trump told the new york times in a recent interview hillary was an enabler and she attacked the women who bill clinton mistreated afterward i think its a serious problem for them and its something that im considering talking about more in the near future  trump carried on a very public affair with marla maples  his eventual second wife  while still married to first wife ivana trump  trump has been criticized in this campaign for derogatory and lewd comments about women including some made on tv and live radio in an interview wednesday with ksnv a las vegas television station trump said that those comments were made for entertainment  a lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment theres nobody that has more respect for women than i do he told the station  are you trying to tone it down now asked the interviewer jim snyder  its not a question of trying its very easy trump said  the tape obtained by the post seems to have captured trump in a private moment with no audience beyond bush and a few others on the bus it appears to have been shot around sept 16 2005 which was the day media reports said trump would tape his soapopera cameo  the video shows the bus carrying trump and bush turning down a street on the studio back lot the two men cannot be seen  oof get out of the way honey bush says apparently referencing somebody else blocking the view of zucker  the two men then exit the bus and greet zucker  were ready lets go trump says after the initial greetings make me a soap star  how about a little hug for the donald bush says he just got off the bus  would you like a little hug darling zucker says  absolutely trump says as they embrace and airkiss trump says melania said this was okay  the video then follows trump bush and zucker into the studio trump did appear on days of our lives in late october in a tape of that cameo posted online zuckers character asks trump  playing himself  for a job at his business and tells him suggestively i think youll find im a very willing employee working under you i think could be mutually beneficial  trumps character gives her the brushoff  thats an interesting proposition trump says onscreen ill get back to you  a publicist for zucker did not immediately respond to

in the first half of the debate donald trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles after peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that hillary clinton is too sick to be commanderinchief one must ask themselves why trump couldnt stop sniffling is he sick was he holding back tears after being pummeled by clinton  howard dean former head of the dnc and presidential candidate has a more unconventional answer he was on drugs  dean who is now a contributor for msnbc tweeted last night  notice trump sniffing all the time coke user  howard dean govhowarddean september 27 2016  trump supporters took to twitter to express outrage completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against clinton and her stamina abilities but hey get offended when dean points out what could be the obvious after all trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system  and considering he hasnt released any medical records who knows what adverse effects drugs if he does them has done to his body and mental state  of course trump denied he was sniffling even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country and the globe and the republican nominee denies that he is sick so that begs the question what else could it be  deans assertion is just that  an assertion it has no factual ground to stand on but it is ironic to see how trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate perhaps they and trump will think long and hard before trying to paint clinton as anything shes not  if this debate showed one thing its that hillary came out on top and trump is not happy about it why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior howard dean is  featured image via joe readlegetty images

less than a day after protests over the police killing of an africanamerican man turned violent in north carolina republican presidential nominee donald trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs  if youre not aware drugs are a very very big factor in what youre watching on television at night said trump in a speech to the shale insight 2016 conference in pittsburgh today  on wednesday night charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of keith lamont scott on tuesday afternoon officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds one person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound  the republican nominee condemned the violence calling for unity  our country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the worlds leader how can we lead when we cant even control our own cities we honor and recognize the right of all americans to peacefully assemble protest and demonstrate but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others  he continued to praise law enforcement officers citing the challenges they face and calling for better training  its tough being a police officer trump said police are entrusted with immense responsibility and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always  and it will be by them  vigorously addressed  but aside from that one reference amid his heavyhanded praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against africanamericans at the hands of police which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets they cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill africanamericans in many instances unarmed  trump in recent days has appealed to black americans asking them what they have to lose by voting for him even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime  during a rally earlier this week in north carolina trump said were going to rebuild our inner cities because our africanamerican communities are absolutely in the worst shape theyve ever been in before ever ever ever  many africanamericans have bristled at that broad assertion while many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty according to census data from 2015 529 percent of black americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree a pew report released in december shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of lowincome earners and according to the census bureau almost 73 percent of black americans do not live in poverty  trump in an effort to reach out to the black community visited cleveland earlier this week appearing at a black church and during a town hall on the fox news channel wednesday night he was asked about the threat of violence  i would do stop and frisk i think you have to said trump we did it in new york it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and you know you really help people sort of change their mind automatically  but this morning in an interview on fox  friends he stepped back from the statement claiming he was referring to a strategy only for chicago  in pittsburgh trump delineated a difference between what he called the violent disruptor and the rest of the black community he said it was the countrys job to make life more comfortable for the africanamerican parent trying to raise their kids in peace to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations

he didnt ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about donald trump said about lester holt  getty postdebate trump team hits moderator holt for some hostile questions  donald trump and his campaign complained tuesday morning that debate moderator lester holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask hillary clinton about any of her various scandals  they were leaving all of her little goodies out they didnt ask her about you know much trump said on fox newss fox and friends but i was asked about my tax returns which ive told about 500 times but you know i think i did  i think i really did well when we were asked normal questions i think i did really well in answering those questions but those questions are not answerable in a positive light  story continued below  still trump was upbeat overall about the debate which he said went really well despite some hostile questions the manhattan billionaire gave holt a c for his performance as moderator praising him for his issuebased questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against trumps real estate company in the 1970s even though it was clinton who brought up the justice department lawsuit  i didnt think he did a bad job you know when you look at it you watch the last four questions he hit me on birther he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that i settled with no recourse and no guilt he asked me about that trump said thats a beauty to be asked you know 40yearold lawsuit or older i just hate to say its older because then youll know then fox news anchor ainsley earhardt will say wow i didnt know trump was that old hey shell be unimpressed  well he didnt ask her about the emails at all he didnt ask her about her scandals he didnt ask her about the benghazi deal that she destroyed he said he didnt ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about i mean you know theres no question about it he didnt ask about her foundation  attacking holt became a running theme from trumps campaign tuesday morning as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator  i was disappointed that lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of hillary clintons candidacy  the fbi investigation pay to play the whole disastrous events that took place in benghazi and libya  that never came up gop vice presidential candidate mike pence said on good morning america  trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway took a similar line saying on cnn tuesday that there were topics she wished holt would have raised  i just would have liked to have heard more about benghazi or emails or the clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news she said you know one of our guests last night was mark geist not mark cuban mark geist whos a benghazi hero and survivor and you know he was within several feet or yards of them and i think its a good reminder to be americans of what her record is on that particular issue  while the republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed clinton at the debate he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall trump suggested that perhaps his microphone which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day had been tampered with  i had a problem with a microphone that didnt work i dont know if you saw that in the room but my microphone was terrible i wonder was it set up that way on purpose he said my microphone in the room they couldnt hear me you know it was going on and off which isnt exactly great i wonder if it was set up that way but it was terrible  asked if clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90minute backandforth trump said she had not until the end of the debate when the former secretary of state brought up miss universe winner alicia machado who trump called miss piggy and miss housekeeping because of her latin heritage addressing trump directly about the namecalling clinton said donald she has a name her name is alicia machado and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november  i know that person that person was a miss universe person and she was the worst we ever had the worst the absolute worst she was impossible and she was a miss universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as miss universe he said she was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem we had a real problem not only that her attitude and we had a real problem with her so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl this was many years ago and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it wasnt quite that way but

as my 25th wedding anniversary approached i tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife i had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other i went to a local coin shop and as i idled over some of the display cases i noticed a set of coins from the mid19th century oddly the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were largeup until 1857 when the coins started becoming at best half the size of the others  oh the panic of 1857 the owner said when i asked him about the change of size it was really bad the president didnt seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins  story continued below  now that is inept presidential decisionmaking during the current election campaign there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility thatwhoever the winner ishe or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence and before the current candidates were known the two most recent white house occupants barack obama and george w bush have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country  but obama and bush can both take heart and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace perhaps from knowing that no matter how badly they do they almost certainly wont rank last by my reckoning that place belongs to james buchanan genial a man though he was ive made quite a study of him my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at lets say the lesser presidents my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of franklin pierce everywhere we went he forced me to read historical plaquesstopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them if i were to write a book about a president it surely wouldnt be about washington or lincoln or even silent cal coolidge it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible  buchanan the only president from my native state pennsylvania turned out to be my man  start with his anemic minimalist solution to one of americas great financial downturns  for a long time before buchanan in effect precipitated the panic of 1857 things were going well for the country at least in an economic sense there had been a bad downturn 20 years before with multiple causes like war in europe the dissolution of the bank of the united states and overspeculation in oddly enough slaves and western land the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk from oregon to california to texas reinvigorated the economy and a boom lasted for the next two decades railroads were the big player since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states manufacturing boomed domestically and then with foreign trade as well since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent  then the day before buchanan took office congress passed what he wanted the tariff bill of 1857 which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroadbuchanan wanted to stimulate foreign tradebut made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive  three days later came the real fatal blow though the dred scott supreme court decision which fell on the shoulders of buchanan the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade but roger taney the supreme court chief justice and a fellow alumnus with buchanan of small dickinson college wanted it settled  scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri a slave state but in the northwest territories which were nonslave after his master died scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory buchanan wanted to be a hero and thought if the case could be decided broadly it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good  buchanan knew too though that the court had five southerners and four northerners and if the decision were split that way it would be ineffective he and taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision or remand the case back to the appeals court if it were merely sectional since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate  ignoring the idea of separation of powers though buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier another dickinson alumnus and a justice from pennsylvania to go along with the majority opinion which taney would write eventually a new york native justice samuel nelson wrote a concurring opinion making the vote even less sectional  legend has it that taney on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate thatand that he would be all for whatever the court decided  two days later the decision came down taney castigated scott whom he said was not a citizen being a slave and thus could not bring any suit he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or conversely prohibit slavery thus all the compromises about it going back to the 1820s were invalid and in fact the fugitive slave law requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country was in force  historically experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the courts history but short of that it was at the very least transformational for the countrywith not just taney but surely buchanan responsible for it  as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time there was a practical downside too now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west to use the railroads or to start a business that railroads might profit from railroad stocks started to decline in value and then a contagion hit and it was free fall by midsummer no one could take a ride on the reading as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game since the reading railroad had shut down as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central several lines like the delaware lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin declared bankruptcy  thousands were thrown out of work and banks started foreclosing on loans and property senator william seward the leader of the new republican party come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he ownedhis stock in the illinois central promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas was virtually worthless  every bank in new york city effectively closednone would convert coins or gold into bank notes the oldest grain company in new york nh wolfe and co failed in august as did the most prominent insurance business in the country the ohio life insurance and trust co  buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria calm words might have quelled it but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and thus more turmoil in markets  the residue that mattered most though was the reaction caused by dred scott instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement as buchanan had thought dred scott thwarted it and brought an end to years of northern prosperity  yet the south did not succumb as badly its agrarian culture was selfsustaining and its cotton still had a market in europe there was a surge in arms sales there as well the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being a southern lackey  buchanans response was underwhelming almost disdainful he said the federal government could do nothing in his annual message in december 1857 he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic but he would do nothing for individual suffering the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started but would begin no new ones he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and deserved the gamblers fate eventually he noted the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph though there would clearly be an interim of rough times  in a sense he was right because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back  throughout his term when a fork appeared in the road buchanan managed to take the wrong turn when hostilities flared in kansas over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid exacerbating the killings some done by the wildeyed antislavery radical john brown when later brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in harpers ferry west virginia just 40 miles from washington along the potomac buchanan again diddled before consulting robert e lee who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid  in other ventures though buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions he caused chaos in utah quelling what he thought to be a mormon revolt causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute he supported mercenary william walkers forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union then there was the little known pig war started when a settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest shot a pig owned by the hudson bay co that wandered onto his property a standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas where there was a real problem out to calm the nonfatalexcept to one pigbattle this was at a time when there were about only 12000 soldiers in the us army stretched as thin as could be  as the election of 1860 came close buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win stephen douglas because he just plain didnt like him that caused the party to split into three factions each nominating a candidate virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election  the southern states which had threatened secession started doing so during the interim between lincolns election and his inauguration in march thus under buchanans watch buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession but the president could not do anything to prevent it  as the first halfdozen states seceded buchanan lost several cabinet membershe had a lot of southern alliesand refused entreaties by many including former president john tyler who would himself become a confederate congressman to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold  meanwhile buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south fort sumter  enter lincoln who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms speeches as the greatest of presidents lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy but i contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan the worst president ever there would have been a few notches more on the presidentialrating scale for abe lincoln to climb  today george w bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of 08 and the beginning of the great recession obama is sometimes seen in the same light especially by the far right but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a president hillary clinton or a president donald trump to shine  robert strauss is author of the forthcoming worst president ever james buchanan the potus rating game and the legacy of the least of the lesser presidents

hillary clinton and donald trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight and they did it with plenty of barbs  the two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at hofstra university in long island new york in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers  here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate  1 nominees started off on a friendly note but no escaping the sarcasm  hillary clinton and donald trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note although the mutual contempt was just below the surface  when clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and trump in a blue tie  the opponents trading traditional party colors  the two shook hands and clinton said how are you donald perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting  shortly after the debate began trump talked about overseas trade deals saying but in all fairness to secretary clinton before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying yes is that ok good i want you to be very happy its very important to me  he seemed to be referring to his addressing her as secretary clinton although it wasnt completely clear during the moment  2 personal attacks came early  clinton was first to go on the attack during tonights debate taking aim at trumps business roots by claiming he borrowed 14 million from his father to start his real estate business  donald was very fortunate in his life and thats all to his benefit he started his business with 14 million borrowed from his father and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people the better off well be and that everything will work out from there i dont buy that i have a different experience clinton said before expanding on her fathers work as a drapery maker  trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in trumped up trickledown economics  for one thing and before we start on that my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and i built it into a company thats worth many many billions of dollars trump said  3 trading barbs over trade  voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the transpacific partnership trade deal  trump accused clinton of supporting tpp the proposed trade agreement between the united states and 11 other countries along the pacific rim  and now you want to approve transpacific partnership you were totally in favor of it trump said  clinton fired back well that is just not accurate i was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out  trump then pointed to clintons once referring to tpp as the gold standard of trade deals  well donald i know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts clinton said  clinton promoted tpp as secretary of state under president obama who is pushing the trade deal while speaking in australia in november 15 2012 clinton said tpp sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free transparent fair trade the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field clinton came out against the trade deal october of last year saying that what i know about it as of today i am not in favor of what i have learned about it  4 trump asks why not blame all the worlds problems on clinton  less than 30 minutes into the debate trump went after clinton attacking her on trade isis taxes the economy and more clinton quipped i have a feeling by the end of this evening im going to be blamed for everything thats ever happened  trump didnt miss a beat saying to his opponent why not  clinton responded why not yeah why not just join the debate by saying more crazy things now let me say this  trump interjected theres nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country before the moderator reminded trump this is secretary clintons two minutes please  drew angerergetty images  5 trump hit over not releasing tax returns  trump clashed with his democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns  i dont mind releasing im under a routine audit and it will be released he said trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the us office of government ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general  trump then pivoted to attack clinton over her private email server i will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes when she releases her 33000 emails that have been deleted he said  i think youve just seen another example of bait and switch here for 40 years everyone running for president has release their tax returns she said you got to ask yourself why wont he release his tax returns  maybe he doesnt want the american people all of you watching tonight to know that hes paid nothing in federal taxes she said  6 the birther issue gets on the main stage  moderator lester holt asked trump what took you so long to acknowledge that president obama was born in the united states bringing the republican nominees recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years  at first trump claimed that two clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into barack obamas birth certificate during the 2008 campaign  a claim that he has made before  and then said that he was satisfied with when obama released his birth certificate  holt noted that obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011 but trump continued to raise questions about its authenticity until 2015  nobody was pressing it nobody was caring much about it trump said referencing the years between the release and trumps decision this month to acknowledge obama was born in america i figured youd ask the question tonight of course but nobody was caring much about it but i was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate and i think i did a good job  paul j richardsafpgetty images  7 clinton defends being prepared when trump questions her time off the trail  trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said ive been all over the place you decided to stay home and thats ok seeming to jab clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonights faceoff  i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate clinton said and yes i did and you know what else i prepared for i prepared to be president and i think thats a good thing  throughout the debate clinton tried to portray trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency she also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail that she doesnt stump as much as he does because she doesnt have his endurance  8 stop and frisk becomes a big point of discussion  trumps support of stop and frisk a controversial tactic once heavily used by the new york police department was discussed at length during the debate  stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city tremendous beyond belief so when you say it has no impact it really did it had a very very big impact trump said  trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional  which it was  and added instead that it went before a judge who was a very againstpolice judge  they would have won an appeal he said noting that there was no appeal  trump and clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like chicago and new york for nearly 10 minutes of the debate  9 trump and the iraq war under the microscope  toward the end of the debate holt corrected trump on whether he supported the war in iraq before it started  i did not support the war in iraq trump said that is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly i think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media  holt corrected him saying the record shows otherwise  the only time trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to howard stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion stern asked trump are you for invading iraq  trump appeared to hesitate responding yeah i guess so i wish the first time it was done correctly  despite the attempt to correct him trump continued to stress he was against the war saying the record shows that i am right  10 sparring over stamina  holt asked trump about when he once said that clinton does not have a presidential look asking trump what he meant by that trump pivoted to attack her stamina  she doesnt have the look she doesnt have the stamina trump said i said she doesnt have the stamina and i dont believe she does have the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina  trump has been hitting clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months but tonight clinton tried to shut that line of attack down  well as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal a ceasefire a release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina clinton said  she also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women  one thing lester he tried to switch from looks to stamina clinton said but this is a man who has called women pigs slobs and dogs and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers who has said women dont deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men

i was a democrat all my life i came to washington to serve president john kennedy and attorney general robert kennedy when the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own i joined his senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination i ran on a losing democratic ticket in the new york state elections of 1970 when i was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s thengovernor bill clinton was chairman of my national committee for the police corps  this year i will vote to elect donald trump as president of the united states  story continued below  so profound a change and a decent respect for old friendships requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision  here it is john and robert kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace to them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life but todays democrats have become the party of war a home for arms merchants mercenaries academic war planners lobbyists for every foreign intervention promoters of color revolutions failed generals exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments we have american military bases in 80 countries and there are now american military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries generals and admirals announce our national policies theater commanders are our principal ambassadors our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action  nor has the democratic party candidate for president this year hillary clinton sought peace instead she has pushed america into successive invasions successive efforts at regime change she has sought to prevent americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with president vladimir putin of russia by characterizing him as another hitler she proclaims herself ready to invade syria immediately after taking the oath of office her shadow war cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades the neocons who led us to our present pass in iraq in afghanistan syria libya yemen in ukraine unrepentant of all past errors ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood and the democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with russia for example by sending american warships into the black sea or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to russia itself  in fact in all the years of the socalled war on terror only one potential american president has had the intelligence the vision the sheer sanity to see that america cannot fight the entire world at once who sees that americas natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it only one american candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with russia and china at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking  that candidate is donald trump throughout this campaign he has said that as president he would quickly sit down with president putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists on this ground alone he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors earlier in the primaries and now in the general election  it must also be said mr trump is an imperfect candidate and he would surely be an imperfect president he is crude often vulgar he has areas of great ignorance he insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm he would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words he is often intemperate though it is not trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare putins moves in ukraine to what hitler didan insult that throughout all the cold war and to this day no american president has ever offered to any soviet or russian leader not even the enormous butcher josef stalin with whom in fact we joined to win the second world war and it is not mr trump but michael morell a former cia director now high in the councils of the democratic candidate who has publicly suggested without rebuke from anyone that we should begin killing russians a doubly illegal act of war  moreover trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage willing to defy the hysteria of the washington war hawks the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually antiamerican for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their onenote devotion to war    john kennedy admired political courage he began his first campaign for congress at the height of the cold war by saying above all day and night with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess we must work for peace we must not have another war years later in the cuban missile crisis of 1962 he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders government officials and other public leaders to prevent a war with the soviet union there were 13 men in the excomm room and robert kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war  but within a year thereafter deeply affected by the barelyaverted catastrophe president kennedy had forged a close working relationship with soviet leader nikita khrushchev spoke all over the country to promote peace policies and delivered his historic american university speech of 1963 our strategy of peace he said was not a pax americana enforced on the world by american weapons of war rather it must be founded on negotiation cooperation in areas of mutual interest and recognition that our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet we all breathe the same air we all cherish our childrens future and we are all mortal as to our great adversary the soviet union he said we must reexamine our own attitudeas individuals and as a nationfor our attitude is as essential as theirs  six months later he was dead and it was robert kennedy who must resume the effort robert kennedy made ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty the early centerpiece of his senate career but as president lyndon johnson escalated the war in vietnam it was that war which forced robert kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency wherever he campaigned in 1968 to virtually every audience he spoke of the loss the horror the infinite tragedy of that war in words that could be and must be repeated today after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world  our brave young men he said are dying in the swamps of southeast asia which of them might have written a poem which of them might have cured cancer which of them might have played in a world series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university which of them would have taught a child to read it is our responsibility to let these men live  it is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country  he also urged that we consider the vietnamese mother desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky sent by machines from a country she could barely understand he demanded of his colleagues on the senate floor to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world to arrogate to ourselves the power of god the rule of life and death over others all this is our responsibility he said not just a nations responsibility but yours and mine  john and robert kennedy were no pacifists nor ignorant of the realities of power but they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint and with humility both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death  the legacy of jfk  rfk is being abandoned by todays democratic party  theirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by todays democratic party we have broken one middle eastern nation after another hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins hundreds of thousands are dead millions are refugees and for all the press and political thundering against the menace of isis al qaeda or islamic terrorism generally our military leaders offer no prospects of victory they cannot tell us what victory would require or mean though they are quick to assure us as in libya today that this conflict will go on indefinitely they cannot even explain how some of our current allies example turkey are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies example the kurds so a democratic administration carrying on the work of the bush presidency without thought and without question year after year has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder  scores of democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in vietnam today there is only the voice of the marvelous democratic member of congress tulsi gabbard a reservist who has twice deployed to iraq and knows of what she speaks and it is a democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world flaunting for all to see americas unique military technology coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations  most amazing of all however is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten europe threaten the united states threaten western civilization itselfas we face all this we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat  where are we sending our warriors our ships our planes why to russia which the us general who commands nato has announced is the prime existential threat to america as you read this ground air and naval forces of nato led and largely paid for by the united states have been moving about the western borders of russia carrying out the largest military maneuvers since world war ii at the same time our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the south china sea there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of china our second said to be existential enemy  there are no russian terrorists ravaging france or italy or america isis is not to be found on russian soil the only russian terrorists who have attacked the west are the islamists whom president putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999 the only chinese terrorists are uighurs who are attacking not us but china itself it would seem elementary common sense that america would have long since sought not to fight with russia and china but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation including the isis that is terrorizing europe today  former defense secretary william perry a democrat warns that we are now today on the threshold of a new cold war  a new nuclear arms race  the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the cold war  surely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire and our empire as every thoughtful person knows is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by america by our governments our corporations our households our students and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future the years of constant combat have exhausted our military false hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago our forces are worn out especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade  but ominously there is more to come more that already stares us in the face the dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home this is not a danger imported from syria or iraq or russia our greatest menace is the danger of our own history our inheritance to the latest day  for the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings we were neglecting our own country and our own people our own neighbors our own children and our own friends and now we can see the result the violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own the money we squandered on bombs in iraq was not available for our own schools the brilliant young men and women who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto they were not here to police the mean streets to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty they were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the american constitution to the least among us they were not here to protect american cities and enrich american lives  and they were not here to keep americans and american children from murdering american police officers this is our true present danger    so my hope for america is this first we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless unnecessary and therefore murderous wars we need our best young people to help us here at home we need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments we need to breathe free again  we must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies isis and its brethren must be eliminated no quarter no hesitation but we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense we must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies we must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations especially russia and china  president kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security in this dangerous world would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with russia and the russian people indeed at the end of his presidency ronald reagan said the same fools in washington intent on world domination would have us ignore that wisdom now but it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our childrens future  second we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace there are many ills to be cured many shortcomings to be righted  but nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police an insurrection against the constitution itself our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments we need many more and better police we need them to be better trained not as warriors but as shepherds as leaders and teachers of the young as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years we need our very best young people not getting their legs blown off by ieds in afghanistan but saving all of our lives in st louis and chicago and detroit and baton rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land  donald trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying america first but to demand that all the actions of government at home or abroad be first directed at the interests and wellbeing of our own country is not oldfashioned or outmoded rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of american statesmen from the founders on only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens and a full commitment to those interests can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond  finally our president has told us we must lower our voices of course we do not hope for domestic discord but the people of the united states have perhaps stood silent for too long the elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction from the heights of their power and eminence these are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster this president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems and when we ask who will be the target for these worlddestroying weapons says only there can be no business as usual with russia  surely he must have misspoken for anyone can see we are on a course of madness we simply cannot fight the entire world russia and china and all the nations of the mideast and fight a war at home all at the same time  and therefore we citizens must not be silent we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice a voice as powerful as washington as jefferson as lincoln as martin luther king  return to the wisdom of the founders who fought necessary wars to defend the union but sought no foreign conquests  do not step over the threshold of a new cold war a new nuclear arms race with russia and china but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization  commit to our own domestic peace and security rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations  this as i understand it is the platform of donald trump it was not the republican party platform and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination but it is his platform it is the platform he has restated again and again with determination and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics it is a platform that even in these troubled days could fulfill the hopes of the greatest americans of all parties  well may we seek reassurance whether mr trump has the kind of cool judgment and selfpossession that the presidency requires the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis that saves a nation or perhaps a world no one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures but trump has given some evidence he set himself a unique course toward the office disdaining conventional wisdom speaking more truth about politics and about america than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise and yet it is his independence his willingness to name facts however unpleasant together with his great political courage that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job perhaps most important he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets to the immense loss of both  flawed as he may be trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day most important he offers a path away from constant war a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization thus to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace life and death for our people and our country you and i will have to compensate for his deficits of civility in return for peace we may hope as lincoln hoped among ourselves and with all nations  truly america first last and always for ourselves and for our posterity these are the reasons why i will vote for donald trump for president  adam walinsky worked in the department of justice during the kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to sen robert f kennedy

the pressure is on hillary clinton  insiders in both parties agree clinton having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage faces higher expectations than donald trump when the two square off for the first debate on long island  story continued below  thats according to the politico caucus  a panel of activists strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states roughly equal percentages of democrats 69 percent and republicans 74 percent said clinton is under more pressure to perform than trump but democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for trump a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues  she shouldnt be under more pressure but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself the press will give trump a glowing review said a nevada democrat  who like all respondents completed the survey anonymously hillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and trump fails the commanderinchief test  the media and trump himself have set the bar too low for trump a new hampshire democrat added presidents dont get graded on a curve and candidates in debates shouldnt be either  one ohio democrat detected a double standard for the first female majorparty nominee  hillary clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard and this debate will be no exception said the ohio democrat she will have to answer every single question flawlessly exude gravitas look presidential channel bills and baracks oratorical mastery not raise her voice not cough wear an acceptable pantsuit smile enough be likable not laugh and have a good hair day donald trump will just have to show up  republicans also said clinton was under greater scrutiny on monday night but for different reasons tightening polls that show trump eclipsing clinton in some battleground states  somehow she needs to reverse the trend said an ohio republican never seen anyone do it before this will be her chance  and maybe her last chance  she has to stop trumps momentum with a strong debate performance and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance added a virginia republican all trump has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president  among those insiders who said trump was under more pressure  31 percent of democrats and 26 percent of republicans  most pointed to the gop nominees volatile personality  hillary clinton is expected to do well she is a policy wonk said a michigan republican the pressure is on donald trump not to lose his cool he has been doing very well in his public appearances but that is with the assistance of a teleprompter he will have no such help at the debate and if i were coaching hillary clinton i would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible to win the debate all trump really needs to do is meet expectations keep his cool and look presidential  the question we are all waiting to have answered is can he be serious added a michigan democrat can he answer questions directly how will he react or overreact when he is directly challenged can he control his temper  two other takeaways from the predebate survey  most insiders expect clinton to win the debate  majorities in both parties peg clinton as most likely to be the victor on monday night 76 percent of democrats and 59 percent of republicans  media look at who best answered questions and that will likely be hillary said an iowa republican  clintons mastery of issues and policies and nononsense delivery will prevail over bluster namecalling and promises that can never be kept added a new hampshire democrat  but not all democrats were so optimistic about clinton  or the media through which voters will interpret the debate  the press wants trump to win said a florida democrat their disdain for her plus desire to keep the race alive means unless he really screws up theyll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever  some republicans also claimed media bias  in the other direction  the media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history cnn nbc abc and politico will all say she won a virginia republican said but then again everyone also knew that carter beat reagan in their debate as well  insiders think the debate will matter  asked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates  among democratic insiders 66 percent believe clinton will benefit from the debate 11 percent think trump will get a bounce and 23 percent dont expect the debate to move the needle  trump will flounder ramble and lie because he always does a michigan democrat predicted the moderators will challenge him and hell get mad hell complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored hillary first impressions are hard to shake off and this wont go well for him  the numbers were flipped for republicans with slightly less enthusiasm for the gop standardbearer 52 percent think the debate will help trump 26 percent think it will help clinton and 22 percent said it wouldnt have a significant impact  trump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and eventempered said a new hampshire republican he does that successfully and he cuts into hillarys greatest strength  but some republicans said clinton could stunt trumps momentum with a strong performance monday night  if she pins his ears back it helps her said an iowa republican if its a draw its a net negative for her she has to have something to stop his momentum shes got to hit him with a brick  other insiders however doubted whether the debate would have a significant permanent effect on the race  were past the era of the big debate swings the bloodless dukakis death penalty answer the reagan age quip the bentsen youre no john kennedy moments an iowa republican said swing voters are like the california condor a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate opinion media partisan polarization and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears  added a florida democrat does a damn thing matter this year i think not  these are the members of the politico caucus not all

paul mccartney is not dead and neither is the past  this january marks the tenth anniversary of the beatles appearance on the american charts last month rolling stone conducted its first fullscale interview with paul mccartney in six sessions starting in a london recording studio and ending on a new york street the new york sessions took place the day after mccartney had entered the us for the first time in two years visa problems stemming from two marijuana violations now finally resolved  mccartney was cautious in his responses during the first two sessions he and linda remembered being on vacation in scotland when they were first shown john lennons lengthy interview rolling stone number 74 and number 75 january 21st and february 4th 1971 and having been deeply hurt by it at first he seemed to want to avoid the kind of controversy lennons interview had generated but in later conversations he became freer with his answers  because the various sessions were necessarily disconnected our text does not follow in all cases the actual sequence of questions for example mccartneys discussion of his legal difficulties is compiled from three separate conversations one of those discussions was prompted by an incident on a new york street we were walking down 54th street towards the new york office of eastman and eastman attorneys  lee and john eastman father and brother of linda mccartney whose photographs illustrate this interview  a man in a gray suit with a colorful umbrella approached mccartney and asked mr mccartney this is for you it was an american copy of a process from allen klein that had been served on paul two weeks before in london an outraged pr man howled mccartney smiled and told the man thank you very much he was being sarcastic  the villain of the scenario so far as he was concerned was not the man in the gray suit but klein himself whom mccartney calls a punk mccartney claims he sued his fellow exbeatles in high court because it was the only way to sue klein when we queried the head of abkco industries about the suit he seemed to relish the new confrontation he now has the opportunity to say anything he wants in court klein told us he has his opportunity to fight me face to face i am welcoming it now hes in the same ring with me isnt that what he wanted  john eastman made this statement concerning the beatlesappleklein suits and

34 million plus interest  our interviews were delayed some months first by a wings tour and later by a series of recording sessions in nigeria even after that wait the mccartneys seemed surprised at how much we wanted to know in the end they were interviewed in a london recording studio pauls soho office lee eastmans offices and apartment in new york where baby stella mccartney wore the interviewers watch on her foot and the studio of cover photographer francesco scavullo as the interview begins paul is telling how he wrote one of the songs he recorded in nigeria  pg  we were in jamaica on holiday and we were staying in a little house outside montego bay and we read in the local newspaper the daily gleaner that dustin hoffman and steve mcqueen were in town filming papillon they were just along the coast from us we were saying it would be great to meet him have dinner with him so linda rang up shes good at that im always a bit embarrassed  we got friendly and were chatting away wed been talking about songwriting and dustin was saying he thought it was an incredible gift to be able to write a song about something people think that but i always maintain its the same as any gift it probably is more magical because its music and i think it is more magical but take his acting talent its great i was saying its the same as you and acting when the man says action you just pull it out of the bag dont you you dont know where it comes from you just do it how do you get all of your characterizations its just in you  so he says you mean you can just do it like that he was lovely dustin does dustin hoffman impersonation you can just do it we went back a couple of days later and he said ive been thinking about this ive seen a little thing in time magazine about picasso and it struck me as being very poetic i think this would be really great set to music it was one of those passed on bits you know transition or whatever they call it  sees unusually dressed studio assistant  transvestite  so he says theres a little story here in the article he supposedly said drink to me drink to my health you know i cant drink any more he went to paint a bit and then he went to bed at three in the morning he didnt wake up the next morning and they found him dead  i happened to have my guitar with me id brought it around and i said yeah sure i strummed a couple of chords i knew i couldnt go wrong on and started singing drink to me drink to my health and he leaps out of his chair and says annie annie thats his wife he says annie annie the most incredible thing hes doing it hes writing it its coming out hes leaping up and down just like in the films you know and im knocked out because hes so appreciative i was writing the tune there and he was wellchuffed  then we went to nigeria and we were working in gingers studio  ginger bakerarc studio in lagos nice studio down there we thought wed do this picasso number and we started off doing it straight then we thought picasso was kind of far out in his pictures hed done all these different kinds of things fragmented cubism and the whole bit i thought it would be nice to get a track a bit like that put it through different moods cut it up edit it mess around with it  like he used to do with his pictures you see the old films of him painting he paints it once and if he doesnt like it he paints it again right on top of it and by about 25 times hes got his picture so we tried to use this kind of idea i dont know much about it to tell you the truth but what we did know we tried to get in the song sort of a cubist thing   then there was the trouble in nigeria with fela ransome kuti exginger bakers air force you heard about that all it was was we were recording in lagos lately weve gone to two different places to record just for the fun of it weve been to lagos and to paris and in both of the places they say why did you come here youve got much better studios in england or america you must be daft and we say well its just for the fun its just to come somewhere different for a different type of turnon thats all they never really seem to be able to understand it i think old fela when he found us in lagos thought hello why have they come to lagos and the only reason he could think of was that we must be stealing black music black african music the lagos sound wed come down there to pick it up so i said do us a favor we do ok as it is were not pinching your music  they felt that they have their own little ethnic thing going and these big foreigners are taking all their bit and beating them back to the west with it because they have a lot of difficulty getting their sound heard in the west theres not an awful lot of demand except for things like what was it soul makossa except for that kind of thing they dont really get heard  and they are brilliant its incredible music down there i think it will come to the fore and i thought my visit would if anything help them because it would draw attention to lagos and people would say oh by the way whats the music down there like and id say it was unbelievable it is unbelievable when i heard fela ransome kuti the first time it made me cry it was that good  youve just had some musicians leave havent you our drummer denny seiwell didnt want to come to africa i dont know quite why he was a bit nervous about coming to africa were all going to africa to record and if the drummer wont come what do you do you dont say well well see you when we get back thanks a lot we understand you say well er ummm and he leaves  i think guitarist henry mcculloch came to a head one day when i was asking him to play something he didnt really fancy playing we all got a bit choked about it and he rang up later and said he was leaving i said well ok thats how that happened you know with the kind of music we play a guitarist has got to be a bit adaptable it was just one of those things i dont think there was anything wrong with them as musicians they were both good musicians but they just didnt fit in  in the film a hard days night there were the stereotypes  if you remember john the thinker ringo the loner and paul the happygolucky did you object to that no i didnt mind it no no i still dont i was in a film i dont care what they picture me as so far as im concerned im just doing a job in a film if the film calls for me to be a cheerful chap well great ill be a cheerful chap  it does seem to have fallen in my role to be kind of a bit more that than others i was always known in the beatle thing as being the one who would kind of sit the press down and say hello how are you do you want a drink and make them comfortable i guess thats me my family loop was like that so i kind of used to do that plus a little more polished than i might normally have done but youre aware youre talking to the press  you want a good article dont you so you dont want to go sluggin the guys off  but im not ashamed of anything ive been you know i kind of like the idea of doing something and if it turns out in a few years to look a bit sloppy id say oh well sloppy so what i think most people dig it you get people livin out in queens or say red creek minnesota and theyre all wiped out themselves  you know ordinary people once you get into the kind of critical bit people analyzing you and then you start to look at yourself and start to analyze yourself and you think oh christ you got me and things start to rebound on ya why didnt i put on a kind of smart image  you know why wasnt i kind of tougher im not really tough im not really lovable either but i dont mind falling in the middle my dads advice moderation son every father in the world tells you moderation linda laughs hysterically in the background  british parents arent different no theyre exactly the same my dad could be the perfect american stereotype father hes a good lad though i like him you know  i tell you what i think that a lot of people worried about that kind of stuff didnt often have very good family scenes and something happened in their family to make them bitter ok in the normal daytoday life a lot of polished talk goes on  you dont love everyone you meet but you try and get on with people you know you dont try and put em uptight most people dont anyway  so to me thats always been the way i mean theres nothin wrong with that why should i go around slugging people i really didnt like all that john did but im sure that he doesnt now  have you talked to him about that no but i know john and i know that most of it was just something to tell the newspapers he was in that mood then and he wanted all that to be said i think now whilst he probably doesnt regret it he didnt mean every single syllable of it i mean he came out with all stuff like im like engelbert humperdinck i know he doesnt really think that in the press they really wanted me to come out and slam john back and i used to get pissed at the guys coming up to me and saying this is the latest thing john said and whats your answer and id say well dont really have much of an answer hes got a right to say   you know really limp things id answer but i believe keep cool and that sort of thing and it passes over i dont believe if someone kind of punches you over you have to go kind of thumping him back to prove youre a man and that kind of thing i think actually you do win that way in the end you know  what was your reaction when you read that stuff at the time oh i hated it you can imagine i sat down and pored over every little paragraph every little sentence does he really think that of me i thought and at the time i thought its me i am thats just what im like hes captured me so well im a turd you know i sat down and really thought im just nothin but then well kind of people who dug me like linda said now you know thats not true youre joking hes got a grudge man the guys trying to polish you off gradually i started to think great thats not true im not really like engelbert i dont just write ballads and that kept me kind of hanging on but at the time i tell you it hurt me whew deep  could you write a song or songs with john again i could its totally fresh ground right now cause i just got my visa too about two or three days ago and until then i couldnt physically write a song with john he was in america he couldnt get out i couldnt get in but now thats changed so whole new possibilities are opening up anything could happen i like to write with john i like to write with anyone whos good  right now you yourself are working on the mouse gang no its not the mouse gang its a show that will be called the bruce mcmouse show  i was thinking of the zoo gang the zoo gang thats right thats just a theme tune for a television show i was asked to do bruce mcmouse is another thing we filmed the last couple of dates at the end of wings first european tour bruce lives under the stage you see bruce and his family are animated and their exploits are spliced in between wings footage for a television film  are you constantly deluged with this type of offer not deluged i get quite a few you know i just try and choose the ones i like the sound of its not anything i plan out i remember a thing in rolling stone  theres a little bit of chat i read the papers you know  that said mccartneys going to do live and let die so its come to that has it i thought you silly sods because we were talking to another paper and when i said i was going to do live and let die the 007 thing the reporter said hey man thats real hip so it just depends which way you look at it  give ireland back to the irish was the first of your singles in eight years that didnt sell in america and britain before i did that i always used to think god johns crackers doing all these political songs i understand he really feels deeply you know so do i i hate all that nixon bit all that ireland bit and oppression anywhere i think our mob do our generation do hate that and wish it could be changed but up until the actual time when the paratroopers went in and killed a few people a bit like kent state the moment when it is actually there on the doorstep i always used to think its still cool to not say anything about it because its not going to sell anyway and no ones gonna be interested  so i tried it it was number one in ireland and funnily enough it was number one in spain of all places i dont think franco could have understood  at this point paul receives word that a playback of bruce mcmouse is beginning in the control room he excuses himself and we chat with linda while denny laine plays a medley of tim hardin songs on the studio piano  did you feel scared when mccartney was released since that was your debut and the first song was pegged at you no i didnt take it as seriously as i probably should have i think it was good copy at the time to slag everything everybody was getting slagged the beatles were getting slagged i personally didnt realize you had to explain yourself a lot once you get into the public eye i just carried on with my normal life like i had in new york and i just got all this slagging it never really brought me down much though  do you think any mrs mccartney in that situation would have been slagged i think in what was going down then yes there was so much trouble for everybody not done by one particular person that everybody was getting blamed i still cant look at it from the angle that im mrs mccartney you know what i mean i still see me as the person ive always been either you like me or you dont paul likes me laughter  and stood up for you during the slagging he was living with me he knows im a good chick he knows i dont have any bad motives im not a grabber im not any of that he wouldnt have married me if i had been so he stuck by me  i just read totally bizarre stuff about myself people would do an article on me and then an article on yoko from childhood on up i couldnt believe it it was total fantasy i mean none of that happened folks  unlike john who went to a solo career paul went to a group john didnt really go to a solo career there was the plastic ono band and that but paul is very much a teamwork person he doesnt like working just on his own he still gets nervous he likes working with people bouncing off people and having them bounce off him he likes helping people   have you ever entertained the thought of doing a record by yourself not linda mccartneys great single no i fool around with the songs i write but i dont take it as a serious career  you do have the novelty single coming up yes i did a song seaside woman right after wed been to jamaica about three or four years ago i guess very reggaeinspired thats when atv was suing us saying i was incapable of writing so paul said get out and write a song and then about a week ago we went in to do a b side for it of something id written in africa some chords i wrote in africa and we just talk over it its very sort of fifties rb the doves the penguins i love that that was my era im new york you know alan freed and the whole bit  were going to put the single out under the name suzi and the red stripes when we were in jamaica there had been a fantastic reggae version of suzi q so they used to call me suzi and the beer in jamaica is called red stripe so that makes it suzi and the red stripes itll be out someday but ive been saying seaside woman will be released since 1971 and we still havent bothered its a bit like my photography book someday there will be a book  was it strictly through you that your father became associated with paul as his lawyer its through me actually i remember saying to my father when id met paul a few times but wasnt living with him after brian died that he had helped a lot of people out of messes could he help he said well i dont know i said it would be great because i know you could help them out so then i introduced paul to my dad and they got along instantly if he hadnt met my father klein would have just hawked right in there  at this point we retire to the control room linda goes over the walt disney christmas show script then talks on the phone to someone at emi i think the only bit wed like to add is a little bit from 101 dalmatians  paul talks to the engineer of dark side of the moon they marvel at its sales record and the engineer notes that pink floyd are going to give him a christmas present ask for a percentage mccartney recommends its the best present they could give you what that album has done so far is amazing in france its outsold abbey road  how did you meet linda linda and i met in a club in london called the bag of nails which was right about the time that the club scene was going strong in london she was down there with some friends i think she was down there with chas chandler and some other people and i was down there with some friends including a guy who used to work at the office i was in my little booth and she was in her little booth and we were giving each other the eye you know georgie fame was playing that night and we were both right into georgie fame  when did you first realize you wanted to marry her about a year later we both thought it a bit crazy at the time and we also thought it would be a gas linda was a bit dubious because she had been married before and wasnt too set on settling in a way she thought it tends to blow things marrying ruins it but we both fancied each other enough to do it and now were glad we did it you know its great i love it  some of the critical notices on her debut performances seemed to ask where she had come from yeah well the answer is nowhere really  mick jagger had that quote he wouldnt let his old lady in the band yeah that was all very understandable at the time because she did kind of appear out of nowhere to most people she was just some chick i just figure she was the main help for me on the albums around that time she was there every day helping on harmonies and all of that stuff  its like you write millions of love songs and finally when youre in love youd kind of like to write one for the person youre in love with so i think all this business about getting linda in the billing was just a way of saying listen i dont care what you think this is what i think im putting her right up there with me  later we thought it might have been cooler not to introduce her so bluntly perhaps a little more show business ladies and gentlemen id like to introduce you to my better half isnt she sweet and coy  it turns out it didnt matter it didnt matter one bit at the time it was a little rough maybe at the time it was rough for her none of us realized what  it was like someone marrying mick you dont realize  you know theres going to be a lot of fans who are going to hate it but you still end up thinking well its my life i know of a lot of rock  roll stars or just even show business people who will regulate their life to their image it can mess you up a lot i know a lot of guys from the old days who wouldnt get married even if they wanted to wouldnt get married because it might affect their careers the old management thing  you cant get married all your fans are going to desert you so the guy doesnt get married  but the thing is in a couple of years his career is over anyway and he didnt get married and he went and blew it so i didnt well im not going to let that kind of thing interfere with me although i didnt wish to blow my career i thought it was more important to get on with living we went ahead and just did what we felt like doing some of it came out possibly a bit offensive to some people but it turns out that it didnt matter in the first place you just keep going  did your friends in music stick by you at that time or did you find it a little tough or did you have that many friends at the time i remember ringo saying at the time how many friends have i got and he couldnt count them on one hand and thats what it boils down to really you can have millions of friends but when someone asks you how many friends youve got it depends on how honestly youre going to answer because i dont think i have that many no one went against me or anything i think i isolated myself a bit its just one of those things we had just met for the first time were very romantic the both of us and we didnt really want to hang out with anyone else  do you often go back to liverpool we visit to keep in touch with the liverpool scene my family roots are up there our kids love it and my brother still lives there in fact were going to make an album with him in january  will it come out as a mike mcgear album thats right its a singing thing hes quit comedy for the moment were going to do it at strawberry studios in stockport well play it by ear its mikes album  is it difficult for the kids being your daughters i dont think so i dont think theyre going to be crazedout kids but it is funny sometimes i remember i was sitting in a field and heather was leading mary and a little baby on a pony and mary just said to me youre paul mccartney arent you when shes talking to me normally shell just call me daddy when theres company around she knows im paul mccartney in inverted commas  its nice that we have all girls if we had a son it might be harder on him like frank sinatra jr everyone assumes hell turn out to be his dad at the moment theres not much to worry about with the kids  at your oxford press conference you mentioned your fouryearold daughter liked the osmonds linda says your tenyearold daughter is a bit off them now yes she is a bit  but i understand you met the osmonds in paris which is a very unusual situation it must have been as much of a thrill for them to meet you as it would be for a fouryearold to meet them a layer cake of generations  as were talking today three of the top six here england are by them which is the greatest chart domination by a group since 1964 theyre very liked here by a lot of the record buyers which in britain are the young kids  from your personal experience do you think they can understand how much they mean to people sure they know sure i think little jimmy probably knows less than the others whats going on but they seem to theyve got that kind of american showbiz family feeling which does work you can put it down but it really does work theyve been doing it for years on the andy williams show and theyre troupers already you know the kids only eight or something little jimmy but hes already a little trouper he has what a seasoned performer has  when you were in their position did you feel a sense of responsibility or did you feel the world had gone crazy no no we were a band whod been trying to make it big for a long time when youre trying to get to the top when you start to get there thats probably the biggest thrill you dont think the whole worlds gone crazy you think its great that they like you and youre wellchuffed that youre going down so well thats all that enters your head i think that even little jimmy just thinks hey man thats great thats farout you know he just loves it and thats really the best way  when you get thinking too heavily about all of this stuff like anything you can do so many doublethinks on it all you end up with is not liking it which is the only hang up when you end up not liking it then you start to do it less well i always thought just great great band great things kids screaming fantastic fabulous great everyones having a good night out that sort of thing basically   were you frightened of possible negative reaction when you released your solo album mccartney it was your first break from the beatles i was as confident as i ever am about any lp i realize it was more kind of throwaway and done at home than any of the previous ones but that wasnt a reason to worry about it you never know what people are going to think about a record anyway  the handout on the british edition of mccartney didnt appear in america why was that linda and i did a mailout from our house we had made up this little interview for friends and the press and sent them out with about the first hundred albums somebody thought it was supposed to be a thing that came with the album probably because we didnt explain it in the mailing we should have said enclosed find press kit people got the idea it came with the album but it didnt come out in britain in the copies in the stores  i had asked peter brown of apple for a list of questions he thought might have interesting answers looking back it seems a bit blunt and weird but at the time it wasnt meant to be things like are you gonna be another john and yoko no were gonna be a paul and linda little silly things like that  how did you feel people would react to lindas presence she was on let it be doing backup vocals that was her first appearance and nobody said much about that the time we did mccartney as it was largely recorded in the back room she was always there that was how she came to be on the album as much as she was  you did have the release date close to let it be there was some hassle at the time we were arguing over who had mentioned a release date first it was all a bit petty id pegged a release date and then let it be was scheduled near it i saw it as victimization but now im sure it wasnt  seeing that let it be was released basically after the fact do you wish it had not been released oh no i dont wish that about anything everything seems to take its place in history after its happened and its fine to let it stay there  it was the first album to have the little bits on like the type that also appeared on mccartney i rather fancied having just the plain tapes and nothing done to them at all we had thought of doing something looser before but the albums always turned out to be wellproduced that was the idea of the whole album all the normal things that you record that are great and have all this atmosphere but arent brilliant recordings or production jobs normally are left out and wind up on say pete townshends cutting floor it ends up with the rest of his demos  but all that stuff is often stuff i love its got the door opening the banging of the tape recorder a couple of people giggling in the background when youve got friends around those are the kind of tracks you play them you dont play them the big finished produced version  like hey jude i think ive got that tape somewhere where im going on and on with all these funny words i remember i played it to john and yoko and i was saying these words wont be on the finished version some of the words were the movement you need is on your shoulder and john was saying its great the movement you need is on your shoulder  im saying its crazy it doesnt make any sense at all hes saying sure it does its great im always saying that by the way thats me im always never sure if its good enough thats me you know  so when mccartney came along i had all these rough things and i liked them all and thought well theyre rough but theyve got that certain kind of thing about them so well leave it and just put it out its not an album which was really sweated over and yet now i find its a lot of peoples favorite they think its great to hear the kids screaming and the door opening its lovely  the first of your albums with some of those little bitsy things was let it be had you wanted to do that before yes i think so in the back of everyones mind there was always that kind of thing the sound of a tape being spooled back is an interesting sound if youre working in a recording studio you hear it all the time and get used to it you dont think anything of it but when the man switches on the tape machine in the middle of a track and you hear that kind of djeeoww and then  the track starts id always liked all that all those rough edges and loose ends it gives it a kind of live excitement  when you do have rough edges on an album youre open to interpretation theres the famous example of john and yokos wedding album where the reviewer reviewed the tone on the test pressing and said that the subtle fluctuations in this tone were very arty the whole analysis business is a funny business its almost like creating history before its been created when a thing happens you immediately start analyzing it as if it was 50 years ago as if it was king henry viii who said it it is daft actually but you cant blame anyone for doing it theyve got to write something unless they can say i was around at his house and he gave me a nice cup of tea  funny little blue cups he gave it in  theyve got to say well what did you mean by this or what was that tone  with one song you mentioned just a few minutes ago hey jude everyone was trying to figure out who jude was i happened to be driving out to see cynthia lennon i think it was just after john and she had broken up and i was quite mates with julian their son hes a nice kid julian and i was going out in me car just vaguely singing this song and it was like hey jules i dont know why hey jules it was just this thing you know dont make it bad take a sad song  and then i just thought a better name was jude a bit more country  western for me  once you get analyzing something and looking into it things do begin to appear and things do begin to tie in because everything ties in and what you get depends on your approach to it you look at everything with a black attitude and its all black  this other idea of paul is dead that was on for a while i had just turned up at a photo session and it was at the time when linda and i were just beginning to knock around with each other steadily it was a hot day in london a really nice hot day and i think i wore sandals i only had to walk around the corner to the crossing because i lived pretty nearby i had me sandals on and for the photo session i thought ill take my sandals off  linda no you were barefoot  paul oh i was barefoot yeah thats it you know so what barefoot nice warm day i didnt feel like wearing shoes so i went around to the photo session and showed me bare feet of course when that comes out and people start looking at it they say why has he got no shoes on hes never done that before ok youve never seen me do it before but in actual fact its just me with my shoes off turns out to be some old mafia sign of death or something  then the thislittlebitifyouplayitbackwards stuff as i say nine times out of ten its really nothing take the end of sgt pepper that backward thing well fuck you like supermen some fans came around to my door giggling i said hello what do you want they said is it true that bit at the end is it true it says well fuck you like supermen i said no youre kidding i havent heard it but ill play it it was just some piece of conversation that was recorded and turned backwards but i went inside after id seen them and played it studiously turned it backwards with my thumb against the motor turned the motor off and did it backwards and there it was sure as anything plain as anything well fuck you like supermen i thought jesus what can you do  and then there was i buried paul that wasnt i buried paul at all that was john saying cranberry sauce it was the end of strawberry fields thats johns humor john would say something totally out of synch like cranberry sauce if you dont realize that johns apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it then you start to hear a funny little word there and you think aha  when you were alive and presumed dead what did you think someone from the office rang me up and said look paul youre dead and i said oh i dont agree with that and they said look what are you going to do about it its a big thing breaking in america youre dead and so i said leave it just let them say it itll probably be the best publicity weve ever had and i wont have to do a thing except stay alive so i managed to stay alive through it  a couple of people came up and said can i photograph you to prove youre not dead coincidentally around about that time i was playing down a lot of the old beatle image and getting a bit more to what i felt was me letting me beard grow and not being so hung up on keeping fresh and clean i looked different more laid back and so i had people coming up saying youre not him and i was beginning to think i am you know but i know what you mean i dont look like him but believe me  you were supposedly billy shears according to one of the theories ringos billy shears definitely that was just in the production of sgt pepper it just happened to turn out that we dreamed up billy shears it was a rhyme for years  band youve known for all these years  and here he is the one and only billy shears we thought thats a great little name its an eleanorrigbytype name a nice atmospheric name and it was leading into ringos track so as far as we were concerned it was purely and simply a device to get the next song in   your two big television shows were the james paul mccartney and the magical mystery tour shows how were these conceived the mystery show was conceived way back in los angeles on the plane you know they give you those big menus and i had a pen and everything and started drawing on this menu and i had this idea in england they have these things called mystery tours and you go on them and you pay so much and you dont know where youre going so the idea was to have this little thing advertised in the shop windows somewhere called magical mystery tours someone goes in and buys a ticket and rather than just being the kind of normal publicity hype of magical  well it never is magical really  the idea of the show was that it was actually a magical run  a real magical trip  i did a few little sketches myself and everyone else thought up a couple of little things john thought of a little thing and george thought of a scene and we just kind of built it up then we hired a coach and picked actors out of an actors directory and we just got them all along with the coach and we said ok act an offthecuff kind of thing  the james paul mccartney show were these people who wanted us to do a tv show and they said they wanted a nice show and said you can do it any way you want this seemed like a good opportunity you know to kinda get on the telly so that one was just worked up that way we met the guy when we went to morocco we were on holiday then and they came out and we sat around the pool and talked about various ideas and came back to england and did it  were you sorry the magical mystery tour was not shown in america at the time hey i thought oh blimey but  eh  it started out to be one of those kind of things like the wild one you know marlon brando  at the time it couldnt be released the interest in it came later the interest started to grow you know magical mystery show was a bit like that  well whatever happened to it  thats a bit magical itself like the stones rock and roll circus you know what happened to that you know i mean id like to see that so all of those things work out well youve got to be patient everything like that works out well i think it was a good show it will have its day you know  there was an interesting reaction to james paul mccartney some people liked some parts and didnt like others i can understand that you know i think a lot of people thought we could have done more  could have done a better show it was a little bitty disjointed that was a fair comment but i got a lot of letters from people you know just people old people from like red creek minnesota just saying hey man dug the show you know  you told me you still ask your friends is this really good and linda mentioned that you still get nervous about the work and so does this mean you watch critical notices very closely no i dont like criticism whatever i dont think i ever liked it when my dad said i dont like your trousers but i went through a difficult period where i started to listen to what the newspapers have to say  about me  and say some guy would be sittin in new york all hung up thinking well thats not as good as i woulda wanted and i thought well blimey thats only one guy im not going to take it as gospel  linda mentioned you bounce off people after you left george martin and the other three was linda the only person to bounce your ideas off of for a while yes oh yes  did you miss not having more people is there anyone you ask now outside of people in the band sometimes now i mainly bounce off myself i do that more now call it what you will  maturity sometimes if a friend is in the studio ill ask for their opinion and that will make it easier on me the laugh of all this is i say all this rubbish and it all changes the next day  i still read the notices and stuff and theyre usually bum ones when youre expecting them to be great like after ram there were a lot of bum notices after ram but i keep meetin people wherever i go like i met someone skiing as he skiied past me he said i loved ram paul so thats really what i go by just the kind of people who flash by me in life just ordinary people and they said they loved it thats why i go a lot by sales not just for the commercial thing like if a thing sells well it means a lot of people bought it and liked it  does that mean then that you didnt think too much in retrospect of wild life because of all your albums no ah i quite liked it i must say you have to like me to like the record i mean if its just taken cold i think it wasnt that brilliant as a recording we did it in about two weeks the whole thing and it had been done on that kind of a buzz wed been hearing about how dylan had come in and done everything in one take i think in fact often we never gave the engineer a chance to even set up a balance theres a couple of real big songs on there that only freaks or connoisseurs know  well tomorrow yeah tomorrow is one of them its like when im talking to people about picasso or something and they say well his blue period was his only one that was any good but for me if the guy does some great things then even his downer moments are interesting his lesser moments rather because they make up the final picture some moments seem less he was going through kind of a pressure period you know you cant live your life without pressure periods no one i know has  you mentioned dylan sort of being an inspiration for doing wild life the way you did it  hes going on the road of course this month with the band  does this in any way motivate you inspire you no not particularly i mean ive just been on the road last year so my being  doing that just might have inspired him i dont know you know hes a great guy dylan hes a musician and stuff and hes a great spirit love him you know  do you think he influenced you at all oh yes very heavily  i think the first time was in youve got to hide your love away that was johns song then there was a good deal of influence in the hard days night and help periods certain chords the acoustic bit we liked him  we met him when we came to new york and we were together awhile he came to one of my sessions when i was doing ram in new york  you mentioned in the studio that you were influenced in a recent session by marvin gayes trouble man do you think fela or someone else might misconstrue this being influenced by something and stealing something are two different things when you hear the track we did and hear marvin gayes you probably would never know they were related i may be influenced by something but its in my head and doesnt necessarily show in the song here there and everywhere was supposed to be a beach boys song but you wouldnt have known  hi hi hi was the one that brought you back to the top ten after give ireland back to the irish and mary had a little lamb although in britain they played c moon because hi hi hi was banned by the bbc i thought the hi hi hi thing could easily be taken as a natural high could be taken as booze high and everything it doesnt have to be drugs you know so id kind of get away with it well the first thing they saw was drugs so i didnt get away with that and then i just had some line lie on the bed and get ready for my polygon  the daft thing about all of that was our publishing company northern songs owned by lew grade got the lyrics wrong and sent them round to the radio station and it said get ready for my body gun which is far more suggestive than anything i put get ready for my polygon watch out baby i mean it was suggestive but abstract suggestive which i thought id get away with bloody company goes round and makes it much more specific by putting body gun better words almost  it made it anyway in the states yeah well the great laugh is when we go live it makes a great announcement you can say this one was banned and everyone goes hooray the audience love it you know this next one was banned and then you get raving because everyone likes to everyones a bit antiallthatbanning all that censorship our crew our generation really doesnt dig that stuff as im sure you know  helen wheels has done better in america than england as have many of your records past back to the old days have you ever thought of a reason why the only thing i can think of is the foreigner syndrome were british and that means something to an american its like some americans who do better over here like cassidy and the osmonds even elvis  its been suggested that the beatles provided something for americans they had lost with the death of kennedy  youth happiness freedom from inhibitions does that make much sense to you no none at all  in songwriting technique how did you compose with john how did you compose yourself and then with linda well first i started off on my own very early on i met john and we then gradually started to write stuff together which didnt mean we wrote everything together wed kind of write 80 together and the other 20 for me were things like yesterday and for john things like strawberry fields that hed mainly write on his own and i did certain stuff on my own so ive done stuff on my own  when i said how do you compose i meant actually sitting down and doing it did you use guitar or did you use piano when i first started writing songs i started using a guitar the first one i ever wrote was one called my little girl which is a funny little song a nice little song a corny little song based on three chords  g g7 and c a little later we had a piano and i used to bang around on that i wrote when im sixtyfour when i was about 16 i wrote the tune for that and i was vaguely thinking then it might come in handy in a musical comedy or something i didnt know what kind of career i was going to take  so i wrote that on piano and from there its really been a mixture of the both i just do either now sometimes ive got a guitar in my hands sometimes im sittin at a piano it depends whatever instrument im at  ill compose on it you know  do you start with a title or a line or what oh different ways every time its different all my loving  an old beatle song remember that one folks  i wrote that one like a bit of poetry and then i put a song to it later something like yesterday i did the tune first and wrote words to that later i called that scrambled egg for a long time i didnt have any words to it paul sings the melody with the words scrambled egg  da da da da  scrambled egg  so then i got words to that so i say every time is different really i like to keep it that way too i dont get any set formula so that each time im pullin it out of the air  when did you get the idea you were going to bring in a string quartet on scrambled egg first of all i was just playing it through for everyone  saying how do you like this song i played it just me on acoustic and sang it and the rest of the beatles said thats it love it so george martin and i got together and sort of cooked up this idea i wanted just a small string arrangement and he said well how about your actual string quartet i said great it sounds great we sat down at a piano and cooked that one up  how would you see george martins contributions in those songs in those days georges contribution was quite a big one actually the first time he really ever showed that he could see beyond what we were offering him was please please me it was originally conceived as a roy orbisontype thing you know george martin said well well put the tempo up he lifted the tempo and we all thought that was much better and that was a big hit george was in there quite heavily from the beginning  the time we got offended ill tell you was one of the reviews i think about sgt pepper  one of the reviews said this is george martins finest album we got shook i mean we dont mind him helping us its great its a great help but its not his album folks you know and there got to be a little bitterness over that a bit help but christ if hes goin to get all the credit  for the whole album  paul plays with his children   the wings tour in 1972 was the first time you had toured in six years wasnt it yes  had you intended to keep it that long oh no no no with the beatles we did a big american tour and i think the feeling mainly from george and john was oh this is getting a little bit uhhh  but i thought no you cant give up live playing wed be crazy to but then we did a concert tour i really hated and i came off stormy and saying bloody hell i really agree with you now  where was that in america somewhere i cant remember exactly it was raining and we were playing under some sort of big canopy and everybody felt they were going to get electric shocks and stuff we were driven off in a big truck afterwards and i remember sitting in the back of the truck saying bloody hell theyre right this is stupid  so we knew we were going to give up playing but we didnt want to go make some big announcement that we were giving it all up or anything so we just kind of cooled it and didnt go out when anyone asked wed say oh well be going out again but we really didnt think we would so we recorded a lot and stuff and nobody felt the need to go out and play  after six years i just thought it would be good to get out because live shows are a lot of what its about if nothing else you get out there and see what people want i remember at the end of the beatles thinking that it would be good if i just went out with some country  western group to have a sing every day surely must improve my voice a bit  when you did start to play live again were you very nervous yes very nervous the main thing i didnt want to face was the torment of five rows of press people with little pads all looking and saying oh well hes not as good as he was so we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous because it was less of a big deal we went out on that tour and by the end of that i felt quite ready for something else and we went to europe i was pretty scared on the europe tour that was a bit more of a big deal here he is ladies and gentlemen sold all the tickets out  i had to go on with a band i really didnt know much we decided not to do any beatle material which was a killer of course because it meant we had to do an hour of other material and we didnt have it then i didnt have something like my love that was sort of mine i felt like everyone wanted beatles stuff so i was pretty nervous on that  but by the end of the europe tour i felt better and at the end of the british tour i felt good by the time we did the british tour i knew we could get it easily and that i could get it going everyone digs it and theres enough stuff not to be nervous  on the wings tour the one song you did from the past was long tall sally the first time i ever sang on a stage i did long tall sally i must have been pretty young probably 14 i feel like i might have been 11 i dont know we went to stay with our parents at a holiday camp called butlins a branch in wales they used to have these talent shows and one of my cousinsinlaw was one of the red coats who had something to do with the entertainment he called us up on the stage i had my guitar with me looking back on it it must have been a putup job i dont know what i was doing there with my guitar i probably asked him to get me up or something i went up with my brother mike who had just recovered from breaking his arm and looked all pale he had his arm in a big sling we used to do an everly brothers number something like bye bye love i think it might have been bye bye love in fact we did that and then i finished with long tall sally  ever since i heard little richards version i started imitating him it was just straight imitation really which has gradually become my version of it as much as richards i started doing it in one of the classrooms at school it was just one of the imitations i could do well i could do fats domino i could do elvis i could do a few people smiles i still can im walking yes indeed im  does fats domino impersonation thank you very much ladies and gentlemen an elvis impersonation thats elvis  did many of those black artists appeal to you in the late fifties and early sixties john did several motown songs yes very much i loved all that stuff those were my favorites definitely  when did you first think you wanted to be in a band i didnt think i wanted to be in one i wanted to do something in music and my dad gave me a trumpet for my birthday i went through trying to learn that but my mouth used to get too sore you know you have to go through a period of gettin your lip hard i suddenly realized i wouldnt be able to sing if i played trumpet so i figured guitar would be better it was about the time that guitar was beginning to be the instrument so i went and swapped my trumpet for a guitar and i got that home and couldnt figure out what was wrong and i suddenly decided to turn the strings around and that made a difference and i realized i was lefthanded i started from there really that was my first kind of thing and then once you had a guitar you were then kind of eligible for bands and stuff but i never thought of myself being in a band  one day i went with this friend of mine his name was ivan vaughn and i went up to woolton in liverpool and there was a village fete on and john and his friends were playing for the thing my friend ivan knew john who was a neighbor of his and we met there and john was onstage singing come little darlin come and go with me  the del vikings come go with me but he never knew the words because he didnt know the record so he made up his own words like down down down down to the penitentiary i remember i was impressed i thought wow hes good thats a good band there so backstage back in the church hall later i was singing a couple of songs id known  i used to know all the words to twenty flight rock and a few others and it was pretty much in those days to know the words to that john didnt know the words to many songs so i was valuable i wrote up a few words and showed him how to play twenty flight rock and another one i think he played all this stuff and i remember thinking he smelled a bit drunk quite a nice chap but he was still a bit drunk anyway that was my first introduction and i sang a couple of old things  i liked their band and then one of their friends who was in the band a guy called pete shotton who was a friend of johns saw me cycling up in woolton one day and said hey they said theyd quite like to have you in the band if youd like to join i said oh yeah itd be great we then met up somewhere and i was in the band  i was originally on guitar the first thing we had was at a conservative club somewhere in broadway which is an area of liverpool as well as new york there was a conservative club there and i had a big solo a guitar boogie i had this big solo and it came to my bit and i blew it i blew it sticky fingers you know i couldnt play at all and i got terribly embarrassed so i goofed that one terribly so from then on i was on rhythm guitar blown out on lead  we went to hamburg and i had a real cheap guitar an electric guitar it finally blew up on me it finally fell apart in hamburg it just wasnt used to being used like that then i was on piano for a little while so i went from bass to lead guitar to rhythm guitar to piano i used to do a few numbers like ray charles dont let the sun catch you crying and a couple of jerry lee lewis like high school confidential  then stuart sutcliffe left the group he was the bass player he lent me his bass and i played bass for a few weeks i used to play it upside down and he used to have piano strings on it because you couldnt get bass strings they were a bit rare you know and they cost a lot too about 2 for one string so he would cut these big lengths of piano strings from the piano and wind them on this guitar so i played that upside down for a while im pretty versatile ill give that to myself i wasnt very good but i was versatile  im in hamburg and i have a little bit of money together and finally saved enough money to buy myself a hoffman violin bass it was my bass then that was the one and i became known for that bass a lot of kids got them that was my big pride and joy because it sounded great  and that was it basically the rest you know  in america the anthology album beatles 196770 and red rose speedway were back to back number ones you were replacing yourself did that strike you as odd i thought it was good rather than odd because obviously the big hang up after the beatles broke up was and really still is can any of them be as good as the unit the answer in most peoples minds i think is no they cant because the unit was so good  were you glad those anthology albums were released for the historical record or to combat the bootleggers the bootlegging thing was one of the reasons i didnt take an awful lot of interest in them actually i still havent heard them i know whats on them because ive heard it all before you know i havent really taken much interest in beatles stuff of late just because there has been this hangover of apple and klein the whole scene has gone so bloody sick the four exbeatles are totally up to here with it everyone wants it solved so everyone can get on with being a bit peaceful with each other  there was a lawsuit recently the three others against klein of course i loved that my god i hope they win that one thats great you see apart from everything that went down all the little personal conflicts the reason why i felt i had to do what i had to do which ended up specifically as being i had to sue the other three was that there was no way i could sue klein on his own which is what i wanted to do it took me months to get over the fact i kept saying i cant sue the other three just because its very hard news to go suing someone you like and no matter what kind of personal things were going down and john writing songs about me and all that stuff i still didnt feel like the coolest thing in the world was to go and sue them but it actually turned out to be the only way to stop klein so i had to go and do it  then it all started to come out you know that klein had persuaded george  i dont know how much of this is libelous  our lawyers will take out whatever is libelous klein made his way into georges big songwriting company which is georges big asset the main one was the song something that was on abbey road that was kind of georges great big song georges first big effort and everyone covered it and it was lovely and made him lots of money that he could give away which is his thing you know it was a great thing for him well it turns out that klein has got himself into that company not only paid 20 the percentage klein claimed to have gotten from abbey road  theres a thought now that hes claiming he owns the company  its those kinds of little weird trips now the only good thing i feel is that i wasnt wrong i would have felt really bad if i was wrong and the guy was really a goodie all along and id gone and stuck my big nose in there like the pot calling the kettle black but it turns out he is the type of man who wants to own it for himself and not the type of man who believes the artist should have it and do what he wants with it which is what i believe  he was once quoted in new york magazine as saying he was going to roast your ass yeah well he never did you know and thats cool he wouldnt get near my ass to roast it anyway punk you mentioned you had to sue the other three to get at klein what was klein doing that made you have to sue basically i was being held to my obligations under an old contract i would have to just sit lump it and let him be my manager which i didnt want  so i was told i could sue him i said great ill sue him then they said theres one catch you have to sue apple  and that meant suing the other three for two months i sat around thinking i cant do this not that i didnt see the others i did and kept asking them to let me out and they said no allen says there would be tax complications i said i dont give a damn about tax considerations let me go and ill worry about the tax considerations i didnt want to be an abkcomanaged industry it was weird my albums would come out saying an abkco company and he wasnt even my manager  as it turns out it was the best thing because that got the receiver in there and froze the money and gave everybody time to think about it hes still managed to get 5 million transferred to his own company five million for management the exact amount is subject matter of present litigation  he has a very special gift for talking his way hell use his playboy interviews and hell probably ask for a rolling stone interview after mine even a murderer has a great line in his own defense but hes nothing more than a trained new york crook john said anyone whose record is as bad as this cant be so bad but that was lennonesque crap which john occasionally did utter foolishness klein had already been convicted on ten counts of income tax criminal docket 6672 of us district court southern district of new york shows one allen klein found guilty january 29th 1971 on ten counts of unlawfully failing to make  file returns of federal income taxes and fica taxes withheld from employees wages conviction affirmed on appeal by us court of appeals for the second circuit november 19th 1971 somebody whos been convicted ten times cant be all clean growing more emotional my back was against the wall im not proud of it but it had to be done to him artists are money to me theyre more than that  if klein was the big reason for the breakup of apple do you think there would have been difficulties anyway without him i think there would have been difficulties had the eastmans come in like i wanted the others would have feared i was trying to screw everyone for the eastmans it would have been a bit hard for the others to swallow im afraid since the eastmans were so close to me but they didnt want to screw anybody and the way its turning out theyre settling up most of it anyway some people say people are all the same in business but theyre not  i think the apple thing was great as it turned out the one thing about business is that it does have to be looked after if you have paperwork and bills and royalties and accounts and stuff they all have to be handled very well or else things get lost and then accountants have great difficulty in making up the final picture for taxes  apple was together in a lot of other ways although he didnt get treated brilliantly at apple it was right for james taylor to make his first record then i think it was shameful of them to sue him afterwards but i think that was largely kleins instigation because of the way he works hes kind of ok git the bastard hes left us and hes a success lets sue him we got him we got his contract  but i still think all the records that came out of it billy preston and james taylor badfinger mary hopkin all the people we did take on all had very good records george even with the radha krishna temple i think thats great stuff i dont think you can fault any of the artistic decisions looking back on it i think it was really a very successful thing  the main downfall is that we were less businessmen and more heads which was very pleasant and very enjoyable except there should have been the man in there who would tell us to sign bits of paper we got a man in who started to say come on sign it all over to me which was the fatal mistake  just as i was going to do a radio show interview the other day just as i was walking in this feller walked up to me and said hello paul and i thought id seen him somewhere before he looked kind of middleaged 50ish and i thought whats he want with me looks a bit dubious he pushed a little bit of paper in me hand he said i dont want to embarrass you paul im sure you know what this is all about but ive got my job to do a wife and three kids all that so i walked on muttering looked at the bit of paper and it says abkco hereby sue you john george ringo and everything youve ever been connected with in so many words companies id never even heard of sue you all for the sum of 20 million that is the latest little line  im not trying to be immodest by classing myself with van gogh or with the biggies in the artistic world but it is just a pure continuation of that kind of story the whole idea of whoever makes the thing not being given the profits of it isnt a new idea i think its a joke trying to sue us for that amount of money it is just purely that he thinks in some way that he owns us the laugh is that on that whole klein thing there is one key thing which i luckily never would sign so i feel a little bit out of that one i must say   linda mentioned lew grades claim that she couldnt write that was an old one around that time we had millions of suits flying here flying there george wrote the sue me sue you blues about it id kicked it all off originally having to sue the other three beatles in the high court and that opened pandoras box after that everybody just seemed to be suing everybody  meanwhile lew grade suddenly saw his songwriting concessions which hed just paid an awful lot of money for virtually to get hold of john and i he suddenly saw that i was now claiming that i was writing half my stuff with linda and that if i was writing half of it she was entitled to a pure half of it no matter whether she was a recognized songwriter or not i didnt think that was important i thought that whoever i worked with no matter what the method of collaboration was that person if they did help me on the song should have a portion of the song for helping me i think at the time their big organization suddenly thought hello theyre pulling a fast one theyre trying to get some of the money back whereas in fact it was the truth so they slapped vast amounts on us i cant remember what  i wrote sir lew grade a long letter saying dont you think i ought to be able to do this and do that and dont you think ive done enough and dont you think im ok and  hey man why have you gotta sue me he wrote me back a very rational letter i cant remember exactly what it said but it was a very nice letter hes actually ok lew hes all right  you did a tv show for him after it yeah thats right all the suits were dropped by then bit me tongue  when was the last time you saw george george its been a little while  had george invited you to the bangla desh benefit george invited me and i must say it was more than just visa problems at the time there was the whole apple thing when the beatles broke up at first i thought right broken up no more messing with any of that george came up and asked if i wanted to play bangla desh and i thought blimey whats the point were just broken up and were joining up again it just seemed a bit crazy  there were a lot of things that went down then most of which ive forgotten now i really felt annoyed  im not going to do that if he wont bloody let me out of my contract something like that for years there had been problems as to why the other three felt they couldnt just rip up our partnership agreement i thought it was crazy if we had split up as a band to have this piece of paper still going on we were all tied into it and i wanted to break it up and they said tax you cant klein was saying you cant do it lads youve got to stay together and i think i know why he was saying it he was telling the others it was tax and it was impossible and stuff  there was an awful lot of that and a lot of what i did around about then was just out of bitterness at all that i thought this is crazy no one likes me enough to just let me go give me my little bit of the proceeds and let me split off it was a little titfortat if youre not going to do this for me im not going to do that for you i tend to see the others now just for business its a bit daft actually thats why im so hot to get these business things over with  you were hoping to do it today i gather yeah there was a little thing  you see each time one of us will get hot for a meeting say me i just got me visa and i got all hot for a meeting i rang john up and john was keen to do it he was going to fly in today from la to new york great i was going to be here john was going to be here then i rang ringo and ringo couldnt figure out what we were going to actually say outside of hi there and he didnt want to come all the way to new york from england he was just getting settled for christmas so he was a bit down on it that kind of blew it out then i called john and he said he was talking to george and george was having some kind of visa problems so its a bit difficult to get the four of us together but it will happen soon  lee said that the show youll do for phoenix house as part of the arrangement for your visa will be part of a tour the only thing now obviously is that its dependent on getting a band together if we can get something together in the early months of 1974 then were hoping to come to the states do a nice tour here the phoenix house people helped to get me in its a good cause we just went down to see one of their branches in east harlem just now its fantastic i wasnt thinking it would be much i thought it would be a bit depressing but its a beautiful place theres a lot of love in that place and its not the kind of a state thing theres discipline too but the discipline comes out of love that way no one minds the discipline if you just start off with discipline and nothing else a lot of the kids find it hard to do it but theyre all very selfsupporting now its a great place i must say anyone whos in trouble with drugs pills junk or whatever should take a look in the phoenix house  what was the reaction of the kids when you went in there great we just shook hands their choir sang some songs and we went on a little tour of the house there was a guy telling us about encounter meetings how he was putting the bathroom in doing all the plumbing himself  theyre all very proud because theyre all people who almost messed up they just made it and most of them look like they can really go on to great strength because of it  would you like this to be a big proper tour or small like your university tour a big proper tour i think if youre coming to the states you cant do it funky i dont think i could anyway i think now ill be ready to do a big concert tour although i find it hard to imagine at the moment  now that youre in new york i suppose the rumors will start again therell be a beatles reunion of some sort well i must say like as far as getting together as we were as the beatles were i dont think thatll ever happen again i think now everyones kind of interested in their little personal things i kind of like the way we did band on the run the way we did it something weve never done before and its very interesting but i do think that i for one am very proud  although i dont like the word proud it tends to be  exservicemen have used the word  if you know what i mean  proud of my country  but i will use the word  i am proud of the beatle thing it was great and i can go along with all the people you meet on the street who say you gave so much happiness to many people i dont think thats corny at the time obviously it just passes over you dont really think they mean it oh yeah sure and you shake their hand or whatever  but i dig all that like mad now and i believe that we did bring a real lot of happiness to the times so im very proud of that kind of stuff and consequently i wouldnt like to see my past slagged off so i would like to see more cooperation if things go right if things keep cool id like to maybe do some work with them ive got a lot of ideas in my head what id like but i wouldnt like to tell you before i tell them we couldnt be the beatlesbacktogether again but there might be things little good ventures we could get together on mutually helpful to all of us and things people would like to see anyway  i wouldnt rule everything out its one of those questions i really have to hedge on but i mean im ready once we settle our business crap  there was an awfully lot of money made of course and none of it came to us really in the end virtually thats the story so id kind of like to salvage some of that and see that not everythings ripped off  through all that kind of bitterness i tended to think like john a bit oh the beatles  naww  crap but it really wasnt i think it was great so id like to see that cooled out and restored to its kind of former greatness agree that it was a good thing and continue in some kind of way i dont see gettin the beatles back together  theres certain things we could do quite quietly and still produce some kind of ongoing thing i dont think youll ever get anyone to give up all their individual stuff now everyones got it going too well now  would you consider the ringo album an example of that type of cooperation yeah but i think more than that  i think thats a beginning that shows what someone can do just if he asks thats all he did he just asked us all so thats what i like that no one says naw you go on and make your own album so if its that easy then lots of things could be done in the future and id like to see some great things done  this story is from the january 31st 1974 issue of rolling stone

who is mark billingham the bodyguard claims he fathered brangelinas kids since the news of brad pitt and angelina jolies split many have wondered what will happen to the couples six kids will they stay with mom or with dad or some combination of the two or could a third person have parenting rights as well enter mark billingham the star couples bodyguard billingham said he basically fathered the children according to us weekly  of course billingham is not asking for custody  and even if he did he probably wouldnt be awarded it considering hes not related by blood to the kids and he was only with the family for 18 months but its interesting that the guard would choose to come forward with the details of his employments now especially amidst some rumors of pitts shortcomings as a father  according to billingham the couples primary concern was their children they wanted the guard to keep the six kids  maddox 15 pax 12 zahara 11 shiloh 10 and 8yearold twins knox and vivienne  safe particularly from kidnapping  a former member of the british army billingham described the couples intense protectiveness of their children pitt and jolie didnt want the kids spending time or going anywhere with strangers they were also worried about stalkers who could endanger the lives of their children according to the sun but billingham said he was was one member of their staff that the couple allowed to get close to the kids according to the sun  billingham said he became so close with the kids that he was an unofficial father but he didnt throw any shade at pitt whose parenting style some questioned after jolie filed for divorce e news reported that pitt was under investigation by the los angeles police department and the department of children and family services as a result of allegations that the actor verbally and physically abused the children the allegations have not been substantiated  from what billingham describes of his relationship to the couple and their children its clear that pitt and jolie want whats best for their children in her divorce filing jolie did cite the wellbeing of the kids as a reason for the split pitt in his response also emphasized his commitment to the couples children hopefully with the right support system  perhaps including people like billingham  the kids will get through the divorce alright
donald trump wont say if hell accept result of election  in a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on american democracy donald j trump said wednesday that he might not accept the results of next months election if he felt it was rigged against him  a stand that hillary clinton blasted as horrifying at their final and caustic debate on wednesday  mr trump under enormous pressure to halt mrs clintons steady rise in opinion polls came across as repeatedly frustrated as he tried to rally conservative voters with hardline stands on illegal immigration and abortion rights but he kept finding himself drawn onto perilous political territory by mrs clinton and the debates moderator chris wallace

the new directions of one direction what do the solo projects tell us  this morning one directions liam payne dropped stripped down his debut single which can best be described as something that certainly exists  that is unfortunately the nicest thing there is to say about the track  particularly when compared to the solo work of paynes contemporaries harry styles niall horan zayn malik and louis tomlinson over the past year the four seemed to have called dibs on certain sounds and musical influences leaving liam to try and marry the worlds of ed sheeran and justin bieber to no avail  but well get to that in a second  heres who it seems the boys of 1d are modelling themselves after whether theyre succeeding is another thing entirely  since he quit the band long before the boys called a hiatus its not surprising that the singers debut mind of mine released in march 2016 seemed to dramatically strive to establish itself as the musical antithesis of one direction between interviews that saw zayn slagging off the band and his aesthetic rebrand that saw him secure a collaboration with donatella versace malik seemed keen to distance himself from the artist he used to be in the most dramatic sense  which explains why he took the abel tesfaye road of singing about sex drugs and a combination of the two but where the weeknd took years to earn mainstream recognition and worked his way through the industry zayns fanbase was already built in  which is why his rejection of one direction seemed particularly harsh so while malik is a smart talented and multidimensional person his debut lacked the authenticity that defines his fellow rb artists not that he cant come back from that having spent the past year opening up about his anxiety and keeping his head down he could emerge for his sophomore effort as a grownass man aware that the best artists are the sum of all parts  boy bands and all  with harry its a tossup between bowie and jagger and even robbie williams  particularly when you consider the sweeping nature of styles first single sign of the times enter millennium but thanks to tracks including carolina woman and even kiwi the future dunkirk star seems to have modelled his fulllength debut after the expansive nature of jagger and co  at least if you take into account how varied the rolling stones discography gets after leaping away from garage rock  which is something styles seems to have emulated and recognized from his stage presence which he showed off on james cordens late late show all week to his sense of fashion to the way his album reads like a generous tribute to british rock no two songs are the same nor are two tempos like jagger the singer sings primarily about women his complicated relationship with them and the experiences that come with being a young man what will be interesting is whether he reinvents himself similarly as his career continues  dance moves and all  is this a stretch absolutely but because just hold on saw louis collaborate with steve aoki and do his own singing it seemed the 1d alum was channeling 2017era harris whos been singing his own songs while simultaneously maintaining the djs long legacy of working with big names  its still a generous likening especially since louis has only delivered one track with no announcement of a forthcoming fulllength but that could also be a strategy where his compadres are actively working the circuit tomlinson seems content to drop a banger every so often leaving fans to thirst after him instead of vice versa his longevity however will depend on whether he gets behind the production board or begins working the dj booth because as great as calvins harris vocals are i dont think any of us need entire albums of them  here is a thing none of us were prepared for where our town seemed to solidify horan as the next shawn mendes or ed sheeran slow hands was on biebercircagirlfriend levels of catchy thanks especially to a sloweddown seductive beat  like bieber via 2012s believe slow hands reintroduced horan to his fans as an adult but where zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past niall borrowed from the pages of biebers book and used his songwriting to prove he wasnt just some dude with an acoustic guitar he could sing well he could creatively adapt for a grownup solo venture and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self which justin did once upon a time too while bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause his musical evolution never really faltered and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from so if niall considers himself another bieber that would be brilliant he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success fortunately too old to relive justins 2013 ventures  i  dont know you guys i mean you can see what liam wanted to do he wanted to grow up musically borrowing from the gospel of zayn by simultaneously throwing shade at one direction while singing about sex and parties the problem is strip that down is even less believable  partially because zayn has been candid about his partying and personal turbulence where liam is now a father and because zayn only ever dissed 1d in interviews not in his actual music  however strip that down is largely a thirst trap appealing to a tired brand of heteronormativity through liams references to girl whoever she may be because my dudes hes certainly not speaking to cheryl that way  you can see the way he takes the ed sheeran approach to vocals but loses the heart by bragging about how many women are hanging off him and you can also hear the way hes using the nick jonas approach to postband life by adopting slick beats while peacocking the thing is sheeran and jonas have both mastered their art by making songs seem sincere or as part of an injoke with their audiences  theyre not delivered on a platform built to broadcast their own greatness  so heres hoping that liams next single features more of what hes actually good at singing because while you know hes thinking of himself as a cross between sheeran and jonas hes coming off as a salty brat who has no reason to complain about anything

liberals in the media and the political arena thought that hillary clintons victory was in the bag the rest of the campaign was a mere formality in order for her to make the white house her residence once again  her campaigns plan was to lay low out of the spotlight make little to no contact with the press and just let donald trump do all the talking and hopefully keep his foot in his mouth to draw all the media attention  but now that the postdnc honeymoon is over they have to come back to reality and see that the election isnt over and that they had grossly underestimated donald trump and his campaign add to that hillarys frequent inconvenient health episodes and now even some democrats are talking about a plan b  for the past few weeks the poll numbers have closed in with donald trump taking the lead in several key battleground states  now even hillary is asking why she isnt 50 points ahead of trump  at a campaign event in las vegas hillary video conferenced in to address the labor international union of north america while she was talking about investing in infrastructure raising the minimum wage and collective bargaining she raised the question  having said all this why arent i 50 points ahead you might ask well the choice for working families has never been clearer i need your help to get donald trumps record out to everybody nobody should be fooled  at another point in her speech she encouraged her supporters to stage an intervention if they know anyone who supports trump if you do know somebody who might be voting for trump stage an intervention she said try to talk some sense into them lay out the facts the facts are on our side about what ive done versus what hes done remember friends dont let friends vote for trump  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

kallstadt germany  few places in germany are as representative of the countrys heartland as kallstadt the village in which us republican presidential candidate donald trumps grandfather was born  and from which he was later deported  the hamlet of 1200 people lies nestled among vineyardcovered hills about an hourandahalfs drive southwest of frankfurt it has one bakery and one butcher every year kallstadt holds the saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy pigs stomach filled with pork herbs bratwurst and diced potatoes  trump may have captured a large swath of the american electorate with his signature blend of populism nativism and brazenness and yet in the hometown of his forefather he remains distinctly unpopular  in fact few politicians are less popular in germany than trump a study by the pew research center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy  since a local newspaper discovered that johannes steiniger a member of the german parliament was distantly related to trump the 29yearold has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate with his statements about gay people and foreigners or with the language he uses and with his derogative statements about hillary clinton trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him steiniger tells politico  trumps rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in kallstadt he stands for everything thats bad says sarah bühler yelling to be heard over the 20person brass band celebrating the saumagenkerwe in the towns main square bühler is a former local wine princess the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry  this year a new dish appeared in the towns annual festival saumagendöner a fusion of the local specialty with a turkish kebab everyone is welcome to join us here no matter what color they are says bühler pink purple doesnt matter  tanja huber the 24yearold incumbent regional wine princess nods her head in agreement since the prospect of a trump presidency first became evident late last year reporters have descended on kallstadt seeking a bit of local color a quote or two and perhaps some hometown pride they dont get that we really dont give a damn about trump says huber hes never been here and he apparently doesnt care about us either      donalds grandfather friedrich trump was born in kallstadt into a vintners family on march 14 1869 previous generations of the trump family used variant spellings of the name including trump dromb and trumpff according to local historians or even drumpf according to a 2000 family history by gwenda blair but by the time friedrich was born they had settled on trump  germany did not yet exist as a nation kallstadt was part of the province of palatinate in the bavarian kingdom the region was going though rough times unemployment was high those who had the courage left  friedrichs father died when he was eight years old and his mother struggled to make ends meet at 16 years old friedrich decided to follow his sister katharina who had emigrated to the united states two years earlier he arrived in new york on board the eider on october 19 1885  he entered the us through official channels but he had left bavaria illegally both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service said roland paul the recentlyretired director of the institute for palatinate regional history and folklife studies in the city of kaiserslautern  according to documents uncovered by paul friedrich was stripped of his bavarian citizenship as his own request four years after arriving in the us  but friedrich was not done with palatinate seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister according to the 2000 family history by blair five years after that he returned once more to kallstadt where he met 20yearold elisabeth christ they were engaged and friedrich came back a third time to marry her in august 1902  but while the couple moved back to new york soon after the marriage and had a daughter friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the us and return to the land of their birth my grandmother said i will marry you but i will not go back to america with you donald trumps americanborn cousin john walter told german filmmaker simone wendel in 2012  friedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise in 1904 he applied for permission to travel to kallstadt and although he claimed in his application that he intended to return to the united states within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein he took all his savings from the us with him according to blairs family history  back in kallstadt friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back but though he secured the support of local authorities the district government put a halt to his plans on february 27 1905 a deportation notice was sent to the town office of kallstadt declaring that friedrich was to be told he has to leave bavarian state territory by may 1 of this year at the latest  friedrich was able to obtain a threemonth grace period because his daughter had fallen ill but eventually he and his wife  pregnant once more  had no choice but to board the ship pennsylvania on july 1 1905 and return to new york shortly after that donalds father fred trump junior was born  the authorities said you are not a german citizen you gave up your citizenship you have to leave says walter so they left and they went back to america and thats why donald and i are here  friedrich  now named frederick  died in may 1918 of the spanish flu his widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited kallstadt many times during her life      in february 2012 simone wendel the german filmmaker from kallstadt was given an audience with donald trump roughly two years earlier she had begun work on kings of kallstadt a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown donald trump and henry john heinz the inventor of heinz ketchup  for months wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with trump but his office had not replied to her letters she was only able to secure a visit with the help of walter trumps cousin who had visited kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history  on the day of her visit wendel stood nervously next to walter in a conference room on one of trump towers top floors she had brought a linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screwon tops  her plan was to sit down with walter and trump for coffee and cake the traditional afternoon snack in her home region but when she asked trumps staff to make some coffee the only reaction she got was irritated faces his assistant just couldnt be bothered she says  hello john trump said when he entered the room shaking his cousins hand and looking confused at wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her  trump sat down in front of a onemeterlong model of his boeing 757200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking new yorks central park wendel trying to remedy the situation pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it afterwards i just kept on thinking what on earth did i do she says  the cake looks really good trump said and he and wendel ended up talking for almost an hour  until 1990 trump still claimed his family was swedish a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the antigerman sentiment in the us during the two world wars but by the time wendel visited he had become proud of his german roots they grow them well in kallstadt he told her during their meeting they grow them very well believe me its good stock  wow its beautiful trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born an inconspicuous onestory building with a gable roof thats fantastic see how wellmaintained it is everything is perfectly maintained its great  when their interview was over walter took wendel on a tour of trump tower on one of the floors they ran into trumps son eric trump  have you ever heard the word kallstadt wendel asked him  kallstadt trump junior replied no what is it

kiss gene simmons you want to win the war on terror profile everyone profile me video  it has been 15 years now that we have been fighting the war on terror while during george w bushs presidency we had very few terrorist attacks on american soil but since barack obama has been president that has changed especially over the last year there have been shootings and bombings and yet obama is refusing to change anything after welcoming thousands of muslim refugees from syria we saw an uptick in terrorist attacks yet obama has plans to allow over 110000 more to enter the united states next year they have to be muslim of course because racial profiling is the worst thing anyone can do ever well according to obama and his fellow liberals anyway  but thats exactly what we should be doing according to kiss front man gene simmons according to him if we want to win the war on terror we need to start profiling everyone even him  check out the video below   101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now  everyone needs to get smart im okay with profiling simmons declared i want you to stop me first i want you to stop me because i look a certain way and if im clear than profile someone else its emergency powers during war theres a war going on  but its unfair liberals will certainly cry simmons had a response to that too it is unfair he said thats why the words too bad exist  its kind of sad that the leader of a classic rock band has more common sense than liberal politicians do yes profiling isnt nice but being nice doesnt prevent terrorism profiling does  just look at israel which is surrounded by countries full of terrorists eager to literally wipe them off the map yet theyre not only still there theyre one of the strongest countries in the world somehow profiling works well for them  muslims are not all terrorists we know that but most terrorists in todays world are in fact muslims there is nothing wrong with taking a closer look at young muslim men for example to ensure that they dont have ties to any terrorist organizations like isis if they dont then whats the problem  liberals complain that profiling violates peoples constitutional rights yet somehow theyre perfectly fine with that when it comes to second amendment rights theyre all about gun control because if it saves even one life we should do it even though it infringes upon our constitutional rights yet profiling is completely unacceptable get real liberals you make no sense

on wednesday the senate is expected to override president obamas veto for the first time on a bill that would allow the families of 911 victims to sue saudi arabia  so how exactly does a veto override work  the rules are described in article 1 section 7 of the constitution when the president rejects a bill he is required to return it along with his objections to the chamber in which the bill originated then the members of that chamber shall enter the objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it  in other words the president sends vetoed senate bills back to the senate to reconsider first and vetoed house bills back to the house to reconsider first in this case the justice against sponsors of terrorism act or jasta began in the senate so the senate votes first  both the house and the senate require a twothirds majority to successfully override a presidents veto both chambers also require the yeas and nays to be counted in the house the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the senate they take a roll call vote in which each senators name is called by the clerk  though the senate received president obamas veto message on friday theyre not voting on it until wednesday this is common according to the congressional research service because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill including the amount of debate time on the senate floor  then when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote the presiding officer of that chamber states shall the bill pass the objections of the president of the united states to the contrary notwithstanding  while some senate democrats and republicans have concerns that the jasta bill would open the united states up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with saudi arabia a key middle east ally the veto override is expected to easily garner the twothirds votes needed to pass  assuming it clears the senate the jasta veto override will then head to the house where the same voting process will ensue  if the veto override is successful in the house and the senate the bill will become law because twothirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the presidents objection

362k shares share this story  the new york times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing donald trump as a liar writers at quartz have noted that in at least five articles in the new york times on sept 17 including the lead story in the print edition the words lie false falsely claimed and untrue appeared in headlines lead paragraphs and top sections of the papers trump coverage  executive editor dean baquet said that i think our investigative worksee the sept 17 story on trumps tax breakshas always been hard hitting but we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually liesthe birther issue represents well outright lying and he lied over a long period it is a real word and we will use it when warranted  hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating trumps statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial the rightwing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long the republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged and trumps entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue  but it appears that trumps attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually democratic nominee hillary clinton that created the birther myth which is decidedly false was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the new york times  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

sorry paris hilton never actually ordered kim k around on the simple life  the internet loves to remind itself of kim kardashians relatively humble beginnings that is before she became the worlds most famous reality star she spent her days toiling as an assistant to thenbff paris hilton  whats more the internet loves to relive a few moments of hilton being particularly unkind to kardashian as she allegedly orders her around those moments were forever captured on camera for episodes of the simple life back in the mid2000s  screengrabs from these episodes have become very popular but theres just one problem  the captions are completely fake and your favorite kim kardashian meme is a fraud  heres the conversation that actually took place on the episode  yep that was a scene about giving a dog a pregnancy test  but moving on this gif with a caption of hilton telling kardashian to organize her closet is again also 100 percent fake  and while it may be fake it may actually be better than the real conversation that was had in paris closet that day  paris i love this closet its so good  kim whats going on with this  paris thats my if i ever go to india outfit  kim really  paris yes  kim are you planning on going  paris yes but dont you have to like cover up everything  kim youre not allowed to show any of your hair its like a law  paris are you allowed to have blond hair if you travel there do you really have to do this  kim i think so or youll get like shot or something  paris thats hot  its difficult to pinpoint exactly where these screengrabs with fake captions originated but multiple news outlets just assumed they were real and the myth of hilton as a demanding boss who desperately needed her closet organized only continued to grow however after learning what hilton and kardashian were really discussing at the time the two might now be wishing the hotel heiress was actually ordering the future reality star to clean her closet  so if you want these memes to live on use the right captions

new york cnn hillary clinton and donald trump both met with world leaders in town for the united nations general assembly on monday but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals  both clinton and trump met with egyptian president abdel fattah elsisi monday as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks  clinton who served for four years as president barack obamas secretary of state also met with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and ukrainian president petro poroshenko  while the stakes are high for both candidates there is likely more on the line for trump who as a foreign policy novice is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next monday  trump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief the key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader  i will say that with all the folks being in new york ive had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that im doing well and you know they seem to think its important to maybe meet trump said monday on fox news i dont want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over  he later said ive already met with a couple but refused to say which ones  clinton used the meetings with the three world leaders in contrast to stress her facility with highlevel diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct us foreign policy as president  clinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader according to aides in the room clinton touched on north korea and the rise of china with japans abe while clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant  and free  civil society with egypt while she met with sisi  while reporters were in the room clinton told sisi that she looked forward to talking about the path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society a new modern country that upholds the rule of law that respects human rights and liberties  trump also met with sisi on monday evening in new york where the two discussed the strategic bilateral relationship between the us and egypt according to a trump campaign statement after the meeting  sen jeff sessions of alabama and lt gen michael flynn ret two of trumps top foreign policy advisers joined trump for the meeting  mr trump expressed to president elsisi his strong support for egypts war on terrorism and how under a trump administration the united states of america will be a loyal friend not simply an ally that egypt can count on in the days and years ahead the trump campaign said  the republican nominee who has faced widespread condemnation in the muslim world for his proposal to ban muslims from the us and his blanket statements about islam also shared his high regard for peaceloving muslims the campaign added  the campaign also said trump called the usegypt relationship vital to help promote peace and stability in the middle east  sisi is the second foreign leader trump has met with since becoming the republican nominee he first met with the mexican president in mexico last month  sitting with poroshenko clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges ukraine faces primarily the very real problems and threats from russian aggression clinton added that she was anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts  clintons meetings were announced before trumps and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the white house  if she is elected she wants to be sure she is prepared not only to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on day one said a senior clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views while she has remained a candidate she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins  the meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for trump given clintons lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady  trump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before taking a trip last month to meet mexican president enrique peña nieto earlier this year  the meeting ended awkwardly after trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall but peña nieto said he told trump during the meeting that mexico would not pay for it  clintons campaign seized on the public backandforth between the mexican leader and trump with the democratic nominee calling it trumps embarrassing international incident  when you see that he cant even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president i think the answer is clear donald trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief clinton told voters in ohio after the meeting  for her part clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesnt need to burnish her foreign policy credentials  instead shell take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights  and try to score political points  clintons meeting with poroshenko in the eyes of her aides attempted to highlight the differences between the democratic and republican nominee on policy toward moscow clintons campaign and other democrats have accused trump of cozying up to putin who has built his foreign policy on thwarting us goals and failing to confront moscow over its annexation of crimea in ukraine  clintons adviser said that she believed that washington needed to do more to stand up to russian aggression in ukraine and to allow the kiev government to defend itself  currently the obama administration has offered logistical help to ukraines armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some republicans have championed the official did not say however whether clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the ukrainians  clintons meeting with sisi will make waves in the middle east because of the recent estrangement between the egyptian presidents government and the obama administration  clinton according to an aide in the room emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to egypts future progress and discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation particularly in the fight against isis  clinton also used the meeting to call for the release of us citizen aya hijazi who has been imprisoned in egypt since 2014 after operating a nonprofit in the country  clintons adviser cautioned that the meeting on monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards egypt but nevertheless the official said clinton does understand the complexity and complications of us relations with egypt a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the middle east is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at israelipalestinian peace  sisi assumed power following a coup against the elected muslim brotherhood government in egypt in 2013 clinton had been secretary of state when the us helped push egypts longtime strongman hosni mubarak from power after a popular uprising but was seen as less proactive than other members of obamas cabinet in cutting loose a crucial longstanding us ally  there are a lot of things that the sisi government is doing that are concerning the official said  trumps positions on foreign policy among them on egypt are more opaque than those of clinton but in his terrorism speech in august he vowed to work with leaders in the middle east  including sisi  who recognize that this ideology of death must be extinguished  clintons meeting with abe comes at a time of increased tensions in asia following north koreas latest nuclear weapons test the meeting will likely highlight clintons commitment to us alliances in japan and south korea and the us belief that it is up to china to do more to convince its ally in pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path  clinton according to an aide discussed the threat from north korea and relations with china during the meeting and abe brought up the transpacific partnership a massive 12country trade deal that the japanese prime minister has backed and clinton has rejected  there is significant concern among us allies the region about the prospect of a trump presidency  not least because the gop nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep us forces in their countries and raised the possibility that pyongyangs growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons a step neither nation wants to take

woman accuses bieber of fathering her child  after a paternity test the case is thrown out  for the next 10 months all seems content on the jelena front theyre spotted at a lakers game on a helicopter ride at the teen choice awards and celebrating her birthday but some tabloid sites start alleging that the two may not be as solid as people think  bieber and gomez break up for the first time conflicting schedules trust issues and their young ages are all rumored to be causes of the demise  although the two arent together and despite the fact that gomez tells ryan seacrest its not really about a specific person fans theorize that her new song come  get it with lyrics like cant stop because i love it hate the way i love you  all day all night maybe im addicted for life no lie is about bieber  fuel is added to the fire when bieber allegedly postsand then quickly deletes an instagram with gomez  but at the end of 2013 bieber admits the two arent speaking  although he still loves her  2014are they or arent they  2014 to put it lightly was a confusing year in the jelena timeline  first of all its the year that biebers image goes fullon bad boyafter bizarre incidents in 2013 like peeing in a bucket and losing custody of his monkeyhe gets in real tangible trouble in january alone hes arrested for drunk driving resisting arrest and driving without a valid license and he was also accused of vandalism for egging his neighbors january isnt great for gomez either who checks into rehab  the tabloids viciously suggest its because of bieber andor a drug problem but a frustrated gomez later tells gq that it was to seek help for lupus  but before the rehab and before the dui the couple is spotted riding segways in calabasas california  throughout the year and all the drama the maybe dates continue a starbucks run in texas and a day at the zoo then the instagrambieber posts and also deletes a bunch of pictures of his former beau including one that calls their love unconditional  but concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones    with bieber and other women hes associated with a slew of models upandcoming actresses and other beautiesincluding kendall and kylie jenner who gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on instagram  and she also unfollowed bieber  then theres the international incident in july 2014 when orlando bloom and justin bieber get into fist fight  allegedly over gomez  in november gomez releases the heart wants what it wants which she suggests is about bieber she gives an emotional performance of the song at the american music awards which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course that same month bieber unfollows her on instagram  in december he posts a picture of himself with hailey baldwin but in the caption says hes super single  2015are they or arent they part two  were entering the second of the lost jelena years where no one knows quite whats going on perhaps not even the bieber and gomez themselves  after being spotted holding hands at a golden globes party gomez and zedd enjoy a brief romance zedd admits two years later to billboard that he wasnt ready to date an international superstar like gomez reporters were calling my parents people were hacking my friends phones i was pissed though i kind of knew what i was getting myself into he said  bieber continues to post throwback pictures of gomez on instagram confusing just about everyone including drake  reconciliation rumors ramp up after he tells ellen degeneres that a number of songs on his new album purpose are about gomez and a video surfaces of bieber serenading her with my girl at a hotel in beverly hills  but gomez makes it clear shes sick of being defined by their relationship in her cover story with elle  she says her november 2014 ama performance was her personal life swan song everybody was talking about the same thing my relationship she remembers i was so exhausted i said i want this performance to be the last time i have to talk about this and acknowledge this feeling  early 2016here we go again  in january 2016 justin bieber posts steamy pictures with hailey baldwin in st barths  which many take to mean they are dating the speculation increases when baldwin makes a cameo in biebers gq cover story he describes her as someone i really love we spend a lot of time together  however baldwin later tells marie claire that they werent ever official we are not an exclusive couple hes about to go on tour she said relationships at this age are already complicated but i dont really like to talk about it because its between me and him  bieber posts a throwback picture of him and gomez kissing and she comments perfect  although claiming theyre just friends  bieber posts a series of instagrams with sofia richie however after backlash from fans bieber posted im gonna make my instagram private if you guys dont stop the hate this is getting out of hand if you guys are really fans you wouldnt be so mean to people that i like  gomez responded in the comments section if you cant handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lolit should be special between you two only dont be mad at your fans they love you  that allegedly kicked off a fullon instagram war between the couple involving many comments including cheating accusations on both sides which are now said to be deleted gomez later takes to her snapchat to say that what she did was selfish and pointless bieber deletes his instagram  a few months later its reported that gomez cut her revival tour short to seek treatment at a facility in tennessee my selfesteem was shot i was depressed anxious i started to have panic attacks right before getting onstage or right after leaving the stage basically i felt i wasnt good enough wasnt capable she later told vogue  gomez and the weeknd hit the red carpet couple together at the 2017 met gala  gomez reveals on instagram that she underwent a kidney transplant the donor was her friend francia raisa  bieber and gomez are seen hanging out together again  but multiple sources say its just as friends allegedly their church hillsong

hockey gamefueling tabloid speculation that they are back together and better than ever  maybe or maybe not because if this timeline has taught you anything dear reader it should be that at this point

like much of the mainstream media the washington post is going out of its way to disparage donald trump but the post isnt satisfied with the normal biased reportingthey have gone above and beyond assigning 20 reporters just to dig up dirt on the republican nominee that must have failed because now they are taking the lazy but disgusting way out with inappropriate hitler references twice in this month post columnists have compared donald trump to adolf hitler perhaps the editors have designated september as trump is hitler month at the washington post  on monday they featured a column by richard cohen which said in part   while trump is neither an antisemite nor does he have designs on neighboring countries he is hitlerian in his thinking he thinks the truth is what he says it is  mr cohen didnt mention what despot hillarys lies reminded him of but then again the post would never have a hillary is hitler month while a hillary comparison would be just as wrong the fact that they are only creating a trump month is incredibly sexist  six days before mr cohen another columnist shalom auslander wrote dont compare donald trump to adolf hitler it belittles  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom
keeping up with kendall jenner  when it was announced last week that kendall jenner would be the new face of estée lauder a coveted contract that in the past has gone to actresses like gwyneth paltrow and elizabeth hurley and supermodels like joan smalls the company did not promote the news by way of the usual publicrelations machine with news releases or email blasts  instead after vogue broke the story on its website in anticipation of a 13page spread in the magazine ms jenner was encouraged to tell the public herself on her own instagram account that post quickly garnered more than a million likes 50000plus comments and many many hearteyed emoji  it was the latest plum appointment for ms jenner 19 a daughter of kris and bruce jenner and a half sister to kim khloé and kourtney kardashian her seemingly meteoric rise over the last few years has taken her from a sulky minor player on the sometimes cringeinducing but highly successful reality show keeping up with the kardashians to a tentative career as a teenage model to the runways of the major fashion shows chanel marc jacobs and givenchy among them along the way she has all but redefined what it takes to become a highprofile model  ms jenner is tall darkhaired doeeyed and beautiful but so are hundreds of other girls who walk the runways of new york milan and paris and thousands more who dream of one day doing so what they dont have are ms jenners 16 million followers on instagram 91 million on twitter and 73 million likes on facebook numbers that will surely have grown by the time you read this like many other 19yearold girls she uses these accounts to share photos of herself her family and friends unlike many 19yearold girls she also uses them to plug her many partnerships and commercial projects  i think whats so exciting about her is that she has this social media influence along with a fashion credibility in a distinct way that speaks to millennials said jane hertzmark hudis the global brand president of estée lauder there is really no one else like her out there like her older siblings with their retail stores fragrance lines nail polishes and more ms jenner juggles multiple brand extensions premised on her family fame with her younger sister kylie she is marketing a collection of clothes and accessories for pacsun one of shoes for steve maddens madden girl line and a sciencefiction young adult novel set in a dystopian future colony called indra  but the kardashian affiliation that first brought her to the worlds attention has put her on a peculiar perch followed by millions but navigating aversion in a cloistered industry accustomed to minting its own stars and a historically wary  but steadily warming  relationship with the kardashian family ms jenners agent and several of her clients including ms hudis claimed not to watch keeping up with the kardashians now filming its 10th season  its definitely two different worlds i feel like hannah montana but its fun ms jenner said referring to miley cyruss character who navigates a double life in and out of the spotlight on the disney sitcom that began her career and pop stardom of course both of ms jenners worlds are squarely in the public eye  for modeling purposes and with a touch of wishful thinking ms jenner prefers to go by simply kendall in person she is charming but terse with a daffy sweetness if not necessarily the gift of gab  when she presented at the 2014 billboard music awards she famously muffed her lines dissolving into giggles and admitting guys im the worst reader at a fitting at marc jacobss office  during which a crowd of teenage girls gathered outside of the building hoping to catch a glimpse of her  she was taken with a publicists striking eye color are those your real eyes she asked  she arrived for a recent interview at her agencys office dressed modelcasual céline slipon sneakers a black tshirt and skinny pants tag still on by which designer she wasnt sure they had shown up unbidden at her house like much else a perk not every model enjoys  she is the first to acknowledge that she was not always interested in style on season 1 of our show i would wear like neon green jeans and a white polo shirt the craziest things she said though in her defense when keeping up with the kardashians premiered in 2007 ms jenner was 11 years old  she called modeling a lifelong dream i would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little canon camera that my mom gave me for christmas she said obviously the show was me being in front of a camera its just something that ive kind of always been around initial forays into modeling were small in scale in 2011 ms jenner appeared in the new york fashion week show of sherri hill a designer from austin tex who specializes in event and prom dresses  earlier that year ms jenners appearance at a shoot of ms hills dresses had been a plot point on an episode of keeping up with the kardashians but ms jenners role on the show had largely been as a sidekick to her scenerychewing sisters  with a new agency the society management specializing in highend fashion bookings behind her ms jenner is now working to rebrand we had to be very strategic and specific she said to really have people take me seriously and not mess around  the perceived divide between commercial and high fashion is so wide that when asked whether ms jenners welldocumented sherri hill appearance had been her new york fashion week debut a society representative declined to confirm writing we recall her as still being in school during that period  with a name like hers fairly or not there have been detractors for as long as there have been supporters  it always comes as a shock when i tell the story of how i casted kendall riccardo tisci wrote in an email about his decision to use ms jenner in his givenchy show and ad campaign i didnt do it because of my links to her sister or to kanye as everyone seems to believe i only chose kendall because i thought she was amazing a striking dark edgy beauty exactly the way i like them  even with prominent advocates ms jenners rise was freighted with uncertainty her agent was very aware that she had one shot at being a credible model said the stylist and love magazine editor katie grand an early champion who in february orchestrated ms jenners return to new york fashion week by placing her in marc jacobss show  when the society first asked her to consider ms jenner ms grand was reluctant i didnt even really know who she was other than someone i thought went skiing with harry styles once she said alluding to ms jenners alleged former beau the rumor mill has linked ms jenner to mr styles of one direction and justin bieber among others  ms grand said her first reaction was underwhelmed ms jenners shyness can read as standoffish and she is still developing the presence that can distinguish a top model even today on the runway she can often blend into the endless parade of willowy but indeterminable young women without the identifiable prowl of a model like karlie kloss or the seasoned charisma of one like naomi campbell  ms jenners agent begged for one more appointment on a followup visit ms grand found her less shy more spirited and ambitious theres lots of people that ive worked with at a time before they kicked into the fashion world or fashion consciousness she said marc is very aware of that because weve worked together for so long he kind of humors me a bit its always a bit of an eye glaze and really are we really going to do that  they did mr jacobs initially skeptical came around largely because ms grand said she looked really good in the clothes the reaction thanks in no small part to the look ms jenner wore  which included a breastbaring sheer top  was immediate i was in a car on the way to the airport immediately after the show to go to london ms grand said i was just looking through twitter and it was everywhere i think i didnt really realize it would be such a thing  but despite the ensuing cacophony not only from fashion blogs but also the daily mail fox news and more ms jenner kept a limited schedule that season walking only for mr jacobs mr tisci giles deacon in london another ms grand client and karl lagerfeld at chanel  more followed she appeared in chanels couture show in july and on the cover of ms grands love magazine during the spring 2015 season in september she expanded her show list to add diane von furstenberg tommy hilfiger and dolce  gabbana among others she is one of a handful of models in the new karl lagerfeld spring ad campaign and is said to be in spring ads for marc jacobs as well michael ariano a representative for marc jacobs said he could neither confirm nor deny this  although she said she was happiest to go unrecognized at castings and shows  even in one case being asked by a makeup artist did you know kendall jenner is here  the media has noted her every appearance and stoked rumors  in touch weekly reported that other models threatened by ms jenners ascendancy taunted her by putting out cigarettes in her drink ms jenners representatives dispute this ok magazine splashed a runway shot and a photo of a weeping kim across its cover under the headline kendall im the hot one now  there are those in the industry who resent the intrusion of celebrity into the hermetic runway world though ms jenners high profile largely ensures that they complain privately rather than publicly ms jenner is not the only model to make the leap  her friends gigi hadid a daughter of the real housewife of beverly hills yolanda foster and hailey baldwin a daughter of stephen baldwin have too  but she is the most famous  photo  ms jenner credit bon duke for the new york times ms jenners dual citizenship as it were in the realms of fashion and celebrity is a decisive factor in her appeal  after the announcement of her estée lauder campaign social media responded both in favor of ms jenners appointment and opposed to it esteelauder have you lost your mind asked one user on twitter do you really understand your customer base where did you pluck kendall jenner from  but its executives know both who their customers are  in the united states and europe women as close to kris jenners age as to kendalls  and who they hope new ones might be according to data provided by the company on the saturday of the announcement estéelaudercom received six times the number of unique visitors as on an average saturday within 48 hours of the announcement 90 percent of visitors to the site were firsttimers 71 percent viewing the site on a mobile device  it speaks volumes to where we are right now in terms of nontraditional media said chris gay the general manager of the society of the estée lauder campaign millennials are not into traditional media how theyre getting their media is completely fractured  as models have gone from muses to marketing partners their social presences global reach and audience engagement have become a more important part of their appeal theres no q ratings for models mr gay said referring to q scores a measurement of consumer awareness of and favorability toward brands characters and personalities that was never part of the equation but now you have real analytics  the q scores company does in fact track a number of models ms jenner has an awareness percentage of 33 among the general population which puts her in line with actresses like kerry washington and only 2 percentage points below gisele bündchen the worlds highestpaid model her q score measuring the percentage of respondents who called her one of their favorites is 10 to ms bündchens 13  ms jenners friend olivier rousteing the creative director of balmain depended less on analytics than personal experience when he decided after spending time with her at kim kardashian and kanye wests wedding to cast her in his spring show but he was not

a billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his fathers inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation but in this case its not donald trump its jim justice the democratic candidate for governor in west virginia and a coal baron to boot  like trump justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself and like trump justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern eschewing hillary clinton and barack obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business as west virginias only billionaire he can selffund pumping 22 million into his campaign through midjune justice faces stiff crosswinds however running as a downballot democrat in one of trumps strongest states  story continued below  west virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate but a metronews west virginia poll released earlier this month showed trump with a 4931 advantage over hillary clinton who won only 36 percent to bernie sanders 51 percent in the states may 10 primary in an era of declining splitticket voting justice must outperform clinton by double digits to win  thats led to a dynamic in which west virginias gop candidate for governor state senate president bill cole is embracing trump while justice is distancing himself from clinton its very nearly the opposite of whats happening in other states with close races  across the nation democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use trump as a weapon in this race its pretty clear democrats are trying to localize because trump is not a drag but an asset for cole says kyle kondik managing editor of larry sabatos crystal ball at the university of virginias center for politics this is one of the few places in the country where republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than democrats are  in this race trump isnt a drag on republicans hes an asset  the reason is simple coal republicans have dominated appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning democrats with war on coal rhetoric blaming obama for the industrys decline its hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron and justice definitely qualifies he inherited an array of coal interests from his father then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the east that growth included the 2009 sale of his bluestone coal corp to russias oao mechel for 568 million then the coal slump hit and last year justice bought bluestone back for 5 million less than 1 percent of his selling price  cole the republican candidate has more elective experience than justice but hes no establishment insider owner of bill cole automall and other businesses cole is finishing only his first term in the west virginia senate having previously served a few months in the house of delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat however cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on triedandtrue conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes banning lateterm abortions and opening charter schools  in a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy that may not be enough even in a republicantilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket  if you think about the primary races here we saw a giant trump win and a giant sanders win says scott crichlow associate professor of political science at west virginia university if you look at trump look at sanders look at justice they certainly have policies that are knownthe wall universal health care the coal industrybut so much of whats driving the appeal for them is personality and image not just a list of policy prescriptions  justice is running as a conservative democrat not unlike former governor and current us sen joe manchin with whom he shares a number of campaign staff hes flipflopped between the two major parties giving money to both and changing his registration most recently in february 2015 when he became a democrat however he says he wont vote for clinton and dismissed coles claim that he supports obama as complete dog snot  and while justice spokesman grant herring says his candidate isnt focused on the national political circus the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar jim is no politician says herring he is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state  at the moment it looks like that approach is working a metronews west virginia poll released september 3 showed justice running away with the race at 46 percent cole with 32 percent mountain party candidate charlotte pritt with 8 percent and libertarian david moran with 5 percent  many doubt the veracity of the metronews poll which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years but most including cole spokesman kent gates agree that justice is winning do i think justice has a lead yes says gates do i think its double digits no  some of that is because justices industry ties largely make him resistant to the gops otherwise effective war on coal messaging which has proven to be democrat kryptonite around appalachia even in districts beyond the coalfields  if youre going to win in west virginia you better be running against hillary clinton says dave mudcat saunders a western virginia political consultant known for his socalled bubba strategy designed to help democrats appeal to white workingclass voters saunders who has said hes voting for trump says voters dont trust clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else she said shes going to put coal out of business west virginia coal miners dont want a handout they want their dignity they want their jobs  if youre going to win in west virginia you better be running against hillary clinton says one democratic strategist  but saunders doesnt have kind words for justice either hes screwed every coal operator in west virginia at one time or another  cole sees that reputation as his big opening his spokesman gates says the republican campaign will open up attacks on justices business record over the next several weeks jim justice is a coal operator but hes not a coal operator acting in the best interest of west virginia gates says his legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land  that record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states in a 2014 series on delinquent mines npr reported that justice stands out among mining operators owing nearly 2 million in unpaid fines at the time that same year a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three justice companies for reclamation violations at tennessee mines including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down  the problems have persisted this year in kentucky justices mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly 2 million in delinquent property taxes thats an improvement from last year when he owed 35 million in unpaid kentucky taxes in southwest virginia tazewell county officials seized machinery tools and other equipment from a justiceowned mine this spring to make up for 850000 in unpaid property taxes when 2015 west virginia property taxes became delinquent in april justice owed more than 39 million  the pattern apparently extends to justices other businesses as well two companies sued the greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the pga tournament eventually settling out of court  justices mining record which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining as well as his issues with mine reclamation has made him the target of many an appalachian environmental activist the cole campaign going negative on justice might not push those green voters to vote republican but it might tip them toward pritt who is running for governor as the candidate of the mountain party the west virginia affiliate of the green party pritt served eight years in the state legislature and is making her third run for governor the last time she ran in 1996 she defeated manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election  both cole and justice have promised to bring back coal jobs but whoever wins in november faces the monumental task of a state economy thats suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry  according to the us census west virginias 2014 median household income was 41576 compared with 53657 nationally its poverty rate was 183 percent versus 148 nationally mining jobs have plummeted falling 19 percent in the past calendar year 26 percent from a decade ago and 39 percent from 2011 when the market for metallurgical or steelmaking coal spiked on the strength of a thenstrong asian economy  mines sit idle as a string of industry giants alpha natural resources arch coal patriot coal peabody energy and walter energyfiled for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping asian economy competition from cheap natural gas and federal cleanair regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas while the market for metallurgical or steelmaking coal may eventually return its unlikely the same will be true for steam or powerproducing coal  the coal industrys struggles havent just hurt west virginias employment rate but also its state budget the reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots in this gubernatorial campaign neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward  justice however has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery he previously owned wintergreen resort in virginia before selling it last year and in 2009 he bought the famed greenbrier resort out of bankruptcy since then hes brought an annual pga tournament and the new orleans saints training camp to the greenbrier  in late june a month and a half after justice won the democratic nomination and two weeks before the greenbrier classic pga tournament was scheduled to start tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the greenbrier and the communities around it when west virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1000year event in parts of the state twentythree people were killed including 15 in greenbrier county and hundreds of homes were destroyed  justice canceled the pga event and closed the greenbrier resort though it opened its doors free of charge to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes he shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the greenbriers reopening date should he win in november however his response to the flooding and actions at the greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment  whether justice will win however remains an open question doubledigit poll lead notwithstanding sabatos crystal ball recently moved the west virginia governors race from leans republican to tossup were being cautious because of the fact that justice will need to run so far ahead of clinton kondik says  trump will easily win west virginia but the winner of the governors race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets and whether democrats remain loyal to their party or break for pritt thats why coles campaign is attacking justice on his record as a coal businessman even as they decry the federal war on coal whether those voters go to cole or to pritt ultimately doesnt matter so long as theyre not voting for justice  in his attacks on justice cole spokesman gates repeated one line a couple of times at the end of the day jim justice is going to do whats best for jim justice  that line has been used about donald trump too the question for west virginia voters on election day will be whether whats in justice and trumps best interests is in theirs too  mason adams writes from southwest virginia hes on twitter at masonatoms

president obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 911 attacks along with victims families to sue the government of saudi arabia  i am returning herewith without my approval s 2040 the justice against sponsors of terrorism act jasta which would among other things remove sovereign immunity in us courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism obama notes in the veto message  i have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 911 who have suffered grievously i also have a deep appreciation of these families desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts  the veto comes at the end of a 10day constitutional window after congress overwhelming approval of the legislation setting up a fight thats likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override  suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant especially considering the presidents high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency by comparison former president george w bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted  the last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is lyndon b johnson  if passed into law the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages  obama and the white house have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of sovereign immunity and put the us government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries  overriding the presidents veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up us service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world white house press secretary josh earnest explained to reporters today  our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with saudi arabia but rather the impact that this could have on the united states relationship with countries around the world  but the showdown has also put the obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 911 families who argue they havent had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks saudi arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort maintaining it had no role in assisting the 911 terrorists  the house and senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent a veto override requires a twothirds vote by each chamber and the white house says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough democrats to block the override effort  obamas former secretary of state hillary clinton has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election

taylor swifts reputation all the gossip about joe alwyn kanye west and tom hiddleston  in the preface of her two reputationthemed magazines which feature photos poetry and handwritten lyrics to celebrate the release of her sixth album swift lamented the inevitable news stories that guess at the targets of her lyrics  when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test she wrote there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because its 2017 and if you didnt see a picture of it it couldnt have happened right  yet even with its controversywinking title reputation is probably the leastgossipy release of swifts career instead of an array of songs potentially referencing different exlovers the majority of reputation is dedicated to a single subject whom swift is still as far as fans know happily dating  the allusions to swifts past dramas are few and far between and when they do show up on reputation they make for some of the albums very best songs swift steers clear of katy perry and squad drama and bashing her exes keeping her apologies short and list of enemies shorter  more taylor swift pop princess wins song of the year at the cma awards  swift is a master at chronicling her soured relationships with many of her finest songs memorializing and sometimes flaming her exes so what happens when swift writes an album about a person shes still into thats the story of reputation and the british actor joe alwyn whom swift has been spotted with over the past year is the man at its center  oh 25 years old  oh how were you to know swift sings on dancing with our hands tied referencing alwyns age at the time she wrote the album hes 26 now the ocean blue eyes swift sings about on gorgeous almost certainly belong to alwyn a motif that repeats on dancing with our hands tied deep blue but you painted me golden and delicate oh damn never seen that color blue swift also mentions his british roots in gorgeous when she sings you should take it as a compliment that i got drunk and made fun of the way you talk calling herself his american queen on king of my heart and teasing do the girls back home touch you like i do on delicate  and beyond songs like gorgeous and delicate that deliberately reference alwyn swift spends the majority of reputation lusting after falling in love with and eventually pledging her loyalty to her new beau the most time shes ever spent on a romantic upswing on one of her albums  taylor swift and kanye west and her squad  swift came out of the gate swinging on reputations lead single look what you made me do with lyrics like i dont like your little games  dont like your tilted stage that seemed directed at west the rapper who reignited their feud when he unceremoniously included swifts name in his famous lyrics  with an album title like reputation fans speculated whether the entire album would be a vindictive screed aimed at swifts enemies turns out look what you made me do was a red herring and west barely makes an appearance in the albums lyrics save for one other song in which swift laughing at the rapper as she dances on his grave  the albums thirdtolast track this is why we cant have nice things is a postmortem of swifts 1989 era when she partied with her squad members on instagram and was buddybuddy with west before 2016 arrived and swifts public persona took a hit  it was so nice throwing big parties  jump into the pool from the balcony swift begins remembering feeling so gatsby for that whole year before she gets to the chorus singing with a smirk in her voice this is why we cant have nice things darling  because you break them  then its wests turn it was so nice being friends again  there i was giving you a second chance  but you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand she sings referencing their fateful phone call about famous that wests camp recorded and later posted to smear her as duplicitous  but im not the only friend youve lost lately  if only you werent so shady she continues raising a toast to her real friends her mother and then eventually to west and heres to you cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do she says before breaking down in giggles saying i cant even say it with a straight face  this is why we cant have nice things may be an enjoyable slice of pettiness but the albums crown jewel of gossip is getaway car which sees swift in full storyteller mode as she chronicles using one doomed relationship to escape another  with lyrics like i wanted to leave him i needed a reason and with three of us honey its a sideshow the song seems to reference the several months in 2016 when swift parted ways with calvin harris and dated tom hiddleston immediately after before eventually splitting with him too to follow the songs metaphor hiddleston is the getaway car driver who whisks swift away from another

if i hadnt seen the last fifteen months of this campaign id have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on monday night it was hillary clinton whether the issue was the way she looked on stage or got the better of donald trump in most exchanges or her calm somewhat more presidential demeanor  so whats my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner it has to do with trumps not failing badly he did not show himself to be unfit for the presidency which was clintons main accusation against him in the countless other occasionsfrom his announcement speech onthe ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that trumps campaign was wounded crippled dead his supportersand every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thoughtdo not hear him the way those of us whove covered campaigns do the insults the sneers that just shows hes the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites the establishment the people who have ignored us ridiculed us left us behind and what of his lack of knowledge demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on monday night it doesnt matter because hes got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system  story continued below  if hes blustery selfconfident to the point of arrogance dismissive of subtleties then thats a sign that hes a bold fearless advocate as he showed again monday night  measured by that standard did anything in this debate suggest that he is unfit for the job as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional republicans have argued clinton did bring up the 50 gop national security experts who have rejected him but trump simply replied by citing a list of highranking military officers who are supporting him  and what of other standard measure atmospherics she was clearly happier to be on stage than he was his water consumption suggested a subtle marco rubio impersonation demeanor its hard to imagine any of those wavering collegeeducated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing  on the respective vulnerabilities he launched one brief attack on her 33000 emails and then  the issue went away by contrast she laid down attack after attack on his taxes his business ethics his treatment of women and the birther issue which he linked to outright racism and his defensesthat he took advantage of the laws of the nation in his dealings with contractors in his explanation of his missing taxeswere somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent its telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime when he argued that the people that are most affected by whats happening are africanamerican and hispanic people and its very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen  moreover her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks calling his birther argument flat out racist charging hed stiffed many of those whod worked for him she managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father a middleclass draper never worked for trump  finally at the very end of the debate moderator lester holt confronted trump with his statement that clinton did not have the look of a presidenta clear implication that this was a matter of gender when trump tried to shift the ground to a question of stamina a smiling clinton was ready  well she said as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal a ceasefire a release of dissidents an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee he can talk to me about stamina  that worked very well i have little doubt that clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate by any traditional measure she was but if this campaign so far has proven anything its that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened and im very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate  jeff greenfield is a fivetime emmywinning network television analyst and author

getty images fourth estate in defense of he saidshe said journalism why we must give the devil his due  the he saidshe said method of reportingin which journalists observe the professions convention and get at least two sides of every storyhas been taking it on the chin ever since new york university journalism professor jay rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ackacking it with regularity  but the he saidshe said debate didnt move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the new york times abandoned mechanical balance and published a page one abovethefold piece by michael barbaro shredding donald trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest birther declaration the times piece elated critics of the he saidshe said construct in an atlantic piece titled the death of he said she said journalism peter beinart pronounced barbaros work a journalistic sea change trump had broken all the rules of political conduct beinart stated and the times had rightly ditched a few of its own abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what theyre actually doing is lying the times piece dealt with trump with astonishing bluntness beinart wrote repeatedly calling trumps birther nonsense a lie trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges which sits just fine with the he saidshe said critics  story continued below  while i consider trump to be a firstrate liar and dont mind saying so im not convinced that jettisoning the he saidshe said blueprint is such a good idea every politician lies if we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way barbaro did trump it would be entertaining but political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances isnt that what the factchecker columns are for  in his widely applauded critiques of he saidshe said journalism rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the other side of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth the media creates a bogus symmetry between the he said voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the she said dissent do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out whos faking it more rosen asked proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion the he saidshe said structure constitutes one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence he would later remark  donald trump the thinking goes has gamed the he saidshe said convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies obfuscations and doubletalk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue a clarification of something hes said or a response to a point raised by his opponent hillary clinton this is true in speeches and interviews hes expressed a broadband stream of lies such as denying that hes used terms like fat pig to describe women insisting that he never called george w bush a liar claiming that he opposed the iraq war making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy asserting that the nfl had contacted him about the debate schedule and more much more but they are lies all lies and every time the media quotes one of trumps she said lies without a correcting factcheck it undermines the truth of the he said side of the debate at least so the thinking goes  but has journalists practice of giving trump the right of reply allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster one result of the straight he saidshe said coverage of the trump style has been his record lows in the washington postabc news favorability poll thanks to this coverage many voters are able to see through trumps posttruth style of politics and dont need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks among his supporters many dont care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the tricksters campaign hes waging for the presidency hes serving baloney and his supporters cant get enough of it  as bracing and as full of truthtelling as the barbaro piece was i hope it doesnt embolden other news pages to abandon convention the formula when properly executed forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles the form is even more useful for skeptical show me readers who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue this i realize can be especially challenging with trump because the mouth of manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything he is the hermaphrodite of opinion makersboth he said and she saidand like any good circus freak that makes him too exceptional to build rules from  one reason i admire he saidshe said journalism is that i often find myself sympathizing with the shesaid side of the equation and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry whenever the shesaid component of a story goes missing leaving only the dominant position expressed i get the feeling im being fed bunk even the holy bible gives satan a forum for his dastardly views so why not news stories  i dont believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides or multiple sides hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium but intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any fieldruling paradigms if you dont mind the languagehave a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques in order for thought to progress the minority reporthowever seemingly misguidedmust be heard  the history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by shesaiders early in the last century for example the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just to oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus to define yourself as a crackpot to be reduced to a shesaid if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story today we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes  or consider the story of alfred wegener he 1912 he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect and his critics take his place as geologys crackpots or take the example of australian doctor barry marshall who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults even after marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment you think its science its got to be accepted marshall told discover magazine but its not an absolute given by the mid1990s the idea finally took root undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery in 2005 marshall and a colleague were awarded the nobel prize in medicine for their helicobacter pylori work science abounds with equally dramatic stories  obviously the critiques of every shesaider dont automatically end in the triumphs wegener and marshall enjoyed but when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis the onesize fits all advice on mammograms has been abandoned our views on saturated fat once almost holy writ have been chucked until 1973 the american psychiatric association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder all is not progress some now argue that homophobia is an indicator of a disorder marijuana makes you mad today the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you coffee once thought to be bad for you turns out to be good for you at least for now moving over to the policy realm the once dominant superpredator thesis was once supported across partisan lines it is now discredited remember how japans economy was supposed to overtake the united states remember how federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said the us economic system was stable experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide and so on  the dissents of the shesaiders are generally beneficial whether right or wrong the dissenters have a way of increasing everybodys knowledge if they are wrong as michael shermer has written their untruths force the dominant paradigm to selfexamine and if warranted use new evidence to improve its position if the shesaiders are right they advance human thought thats how science works and i believe journalism should work that way too vaccine pioneer jonas salk summarized the predictable moves of the kneejerk paradigmdefenders with this progression first salk writes they say that it cant be true second phase well if its true its not very important third phase well weve known it all along  before anybody puts words in my mouth this is not my longwinded way of saying i dont subscribe to the global warming hypothesis i dobut at the same time i keep my options open the protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers even against crackpots  the last and best reason for supporting he saidshe said journalism so many readers and viewers have selfsegregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views these days many readers get only the he said side of the story or just the she said side remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on while i value partisan media i also value nonpartisan news operationslike politicothat make ideas duel in their news pages npr news director michael oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars if you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts that is why the tone of journalism matters so much we need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly and not to confirm our opinions  if youre not getting a steady diet of she said quotations in your news consumption youre at risk of starving to death he saidshe said keeps journalists honest even if on occasion it looks like its only accruing to the

whats kanye wests next move  theres something missing can you feel it a slight twinge in the universe quick and subtle but a definite sign that something in the world just shifted ah heres what it iskanye west just deleted his twitter and instagram accounts  the rapper apparently decided to abolish his socialmedia presence on friday waving goodbye to all those followers and likes and faves those tweets about wiz khalifas cool pants gone that hashtag all positive vibes tweet gone those im so lucky tweets accompanied by nearly nude shots of his wife kim kardashian west banished to the nothingness hinterlands of deleted posts so too are all those random insta photos of old margiela lookbooks for what its worth west was never much of an instagram power user anyway deferring to his wife on that social platform though he occasionally made strong post recommendations his twitter account however was practically an extended part of his brain a home for streamofconsciousness thoughts that caused as much controversy as they did delight so why did he delete it and what does it all mean right now  well this isnt the first time west has waved goodbye to his socialmedia platforms sometimes its because the artist wants to garner a little bit of buzz for upcoming projects back in 2013 west deleted all of his tweets leaving only one cryptic message up june eighteen that ended up being the release date for his upcoming album yeezus which was famously inspired by a corbusier lamp and was released without an album cover or promotional singles  so what could it be this time around west ended 2016 on a rough personal note hospitalized for exhaustion and sleep deprivation he later kicked up controversy by meeting with donald trump at trump tower shortly after his election tweeting about it and then deleting those tweets west as all his fans know has serious political aspirations announcing his presidential dreams at of all westian locations the 2016 mtv video music awards  nevertheless west has been maintaining a low profile as of late and is probably putting his political dreams on the back burner for the moment its more likely that hes deleting his social accounts 1 to get attention andor 2 for an upcoming artistic project the workaholic is constantly working on new music and new fashion for his yeezy season line and adidas collection on friday he and kardashian west launched thekidssupply a highpriced childrens clothing collection he recently released a highend collection of religiousinspired gold jewelry i wanted to create something that represented timeless love he recently told vogue  the only thing missing from his endless release cycle is    new music last year shortly after releasing the life of pablo a release cycle marked by controversial tweets __west tweeted about a cryptic new music project titled turbo grafx 16 after the old gaming console however that project seems to have fallen to the wayside as there have been new rumblings of a nasainspired project though it was later debunked by fans still its impossible to believe hes not working on something new  but maybejust maybewest is    merely enjoying being an incredibly rich celebrity taking a muchneeded break from the public eye the fashionobsessed star recently skipped the met gala an event hes frequented numerous times over the year as the chief ambassador of vibes and shredded jeans why did he skip it he just wanted to stay home according to his wife  hes been taking some time off and really loving that she told andré leon talley on the red carpet  ok well consider that story    for now but dont expect west to stay off social media for too long

former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative chai distributed watereddown hivaids drugs to patients in subsaharan africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation  the congressional report titledthe clinton foundation and the india success story was initiated by rep marsha blackburn a tennessee republican and vicechair of the house energy and commerce committee  the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative  the congressional report focused on clintons decadelong relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy which chai used as one of its main distributors of hivaids drugs to third world countries  it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the us government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm the company was vulnerable to us prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the us market  ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce  the department of justice further levied a 500 million fine and forfeiture on the company  this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company said us attorney for the district of maryland rod j rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty  when companies sell adulterated drugs they undermine the integrity of the fdas approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard ineffective or unsafe said stuart f delery acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice when the government announced its action against the indian company  the department of justice stated in its final settlement alleged due to the companys diluted drugs it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality according to the report  the question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was a false promise asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf  the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clintons campaign  blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obamas first term  the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indianamericans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration fda and the securities and exchange commission  the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundations vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda  it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watereddown drugs  propublica estimated that in 2007 alone the us agency for international development allocated 9 million to ranbaxy and delivered more than 18 million packages  substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from hivrelated infections roger bate an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told thedcnf  thakur told thedcnf that many of the companys antiretroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients  these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize he said  ranbaxys first public hint of problems occurred in august 2004 one year after chai began working with the firm the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa according to the report  the fda sent a public warning letter to ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the companys quality control efforts it concluded that the drugs which included antiretroviral hivaids medications show much lower potencies in these batches  although ranbaxys generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the us chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the companys hivaid drugs to patients abroad  bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in mumbai saying the drugs saved millions of lives  neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy  thakur said hes now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients  the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials but was only met with silence i have tried to reach out to them he told thedcnf but i havent had a great amount of success with the clinton foundation  chai was a part of the clinton foundation until 2010 when it spun off into a separate entity the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff and they continue to operate in close coordination bill clinton for example is deeply involved with both organizations  charles ortel a wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation claims their separation was deeply suspect  in the application trustees of the new entity including bill clinton falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts this is not true they purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called chai was by far the largest piece of the original foundation ortel told thedcnf  the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order  he signed an executive order that relaxed intellectual property policy standards promising the us government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any subsaharan country relating to hivaids medicines or technologies the report states  chai announced in october 2003 it was going to distribute generic lowcost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers ranbaxy cipla of mumbai india matrix labs of hydrabad india aspen pharmacare of johannesburg south africa  chais endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the us government under the presidents emergency plan for aids relief  a 15 billion initiative proposed by former president george w bush  the flow of us funds combined with clintons endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets according to the study  ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications three of which were approved by the fda according to the congressional study eventually the firm would produce 13 generic hiv drugs  the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years the report states  the study also examined the key players in the clintonchai orbit the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions  one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation which clinton cofounded with indianamerican businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in 2001  rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial  vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined 9 million in a securities and exchange commission investigation one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill 33 million without board approval  blackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the clinton foundation  you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients to me its disturbing and very sad she said  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of

this is what justin bieber did instead of going to the grammys  despite earning four nominations for his album purpose justin bieber had no plans to attend the grammy awards this year rather than sitting at home alone however he decided to go out for sushi and took fans along for the ride on his instagram story other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360degree look at what its like to have dinner with justin  of course this move is a statement and not a subtle one at that tmz reportedly spoke to a source that said justin doesnt think the grammys are relevant or representative especially when it comes to young singers  regardless choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect  however this wasnt the only questionable act that went down on justins instagram live feed this weeknd he also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him favorite song at the moment he pauses and then replies starboy by the weeknd before bursting out into laughter making it clear that the comment was sarcastic you then hear the second voice in the video say weve gotta end it now that was too funny  but we beg to differ especially as its not the first time justins taken a swipe at his fellow artist  and its that consistency that is concerning this past january he called the weeknds music whack so we already knew he wasnt exactly a fan its a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex as we all know selena gomez has been spotted with the weeknd and though their relationship hasnt been officially confirmed theres enough evidence  justins response included  to speculate that the two are an item  dissing a fellow artist for no reason and especially when the question posed was openended and positive  isnt cool doing it to your exs new partner is as petty as petty gets if nothing else its shown us that justin has more feelings about the situation than we realized

a louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air this is sadly becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hairtrigger fingers grows what makes this story sadly and horrifically unique though is that deputy derrick stafford also shot and killed the suspects sixyear old son  and stafford is claiming selfdefense for that because of course he is  stafford out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by christopher few which would put the officers in imminent danger  officers went after christopher few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the 2015 shooting they claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down few whose sixyear old son jeremy was in the front passenger seat  18 rounds were fired although few had his hands up but no firearm was found in the car and few and jeremy were both shot while still in the car stafford and his partner norris greenhouse said that after few drove forward and then backed up they were in fear for their lives so they fired  thats always the story though it makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later claiming they were in fear for their lives when its obvious that their suspects were unarmed and even had their hands in the air  reports claim that neither stafford nor greenhouse knew jeremy was in the car when they opened fire few was critically wounded and jeremy who was autistic nonverbal and in a specialneeds firstgrade class was murdered  staffords plea of selfdefense is a huge middle finger to few and the rest of jeremys grieving family arguments will be heard in court next week where judge william bennett will decide whether the indictments stand  featured image via louisiana state police facebook page

getty images wealth of nations trump vs clinton a fundamental clash over how the economy works he sees it as zerosum she believes all boats rise together hillary is right but a lot of people are buying into trumps vision  as he made clear once again in monday nights debate donald trump sees the world in zerosum termswhen one person or one country wins another always loses asked by nbcs lester holt how to help american workers trump responded in his usual way saying america was getting beaten by everyone else around the world and the nafta freetrade deal was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry  we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs  hillary clinton by contrast sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at onceas she also made plain monday by harking back to bill clintons proglobalization presidency which included nafta i think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s i think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again she said incomes went up for everybody  story continued below  that is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence my whole life is about winning  i always win trump says in explaining why hes running the economic plan on his website begins with the rubric winning the global competition you dont get more zerosum than that  despite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zerosum gamebut rather a complex mechanism that if run right can raise everyones welfare at oncetrumps message has resonated in an era when its become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy the zerosum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades as danny vinik recently noted in politico the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow  the recent census report that showed a 52 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an america in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed statistically if the united states is one unit that is true but 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences illsuited to one size fit all numbers and while the averages and medians may go up or down that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number and the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative insecure and economically grim  hence you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the democrats while those who think theyve lost are going toward trump there is some truth there but that isnt a sufficient explanation for why for instance massive percentages of africanamericans and latinos who have certainly struggled economically and socially support clinton  no what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zerosum terms like trump and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of winners without creating a commensurate number of losers that has been the mantra of clinton and her predecessors in the democratic party and it was also the foundation of ronald reagans appeal the belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier  hillary clinton has continued to deliver that message at the democratic convention in july she spoke of an america thriving with economic opportunity with millions working hard and succeeding president obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of silicon valley the revival of many cities in the past decade and the substantial gains on the other side of 20082009 financial crisis judging from polls and surveys those who fit that description  clustered and concentrated in large metro areas and on the coasts especially  support clinton and the democrats by wide margins    is either side right most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billionstrong global middle class in general that view is correct but it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the united states caught in the vortex of rapid change it does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents they legitimately fear that they will lose those homes be unable to afford healthcare that they will see their communities crumble and their childrens hopes extinguished and they see a world of others who appear to be doing better who seem to be winning and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing  the voice of the socalled losers in this global competition is as loud politically speaking as its been in a long time hence trump not to mention bernie sanders powerful insurgency in the democratic primaries the last time so many in the united states were so sour about the inequities between those winning the few and those losing was at the dawn of the progressive movement in the 1890s many early progressives rebelled against an elite vision of social darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can in 1896 the scion of that view was william jennings bryan who painted a picture of the united states every bit as bleak and dark as trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a cross of gold bryan lost two elections and his zerosum view never came to dominate american politics much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system however was taken up by theodore roosevelt and generations of both republicans and democrats some of it harsh and redistributive focused on trust busting and exerting american influence and prestige abroad and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all  trump also enjoys a good deal of subrosa support among business leaders and wall street who certainly havent lack for economic benefits in todays world they arent supporting him with their money but many of them detest clinton and see trump as expressing their world view for wall street that makes some sense in that in the wake of the financial crisis key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable in that sense finance which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid1980s through the mid2000s has been losing ground the idea of gain and loss and that every trade represents a winner and a loser is deeply embedded in aspects of wall street  we have of course no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks but if trump wins he should remember it is impossible to find any society and any point in american history where a zerosum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security zerosum most often begets zerosum whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars by contrast the profound strength of the united states has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zerosum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have a vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers and little else  zachary karabell is head of global strategy at envestnet and author of the leading

robert pattinson twilights the hardest part ive done  he made his name as teenage vampire heartthrob edward cullen in twilight then his turbulent romance with costar kristen stewart dominated the worlds gossip columns now robert pattinson is older wiser and shedding his hollywood prettyboy image he talks about his new role in david michôds dystopian outback western the rover  there is a moment in the rover david michôds futuristic western set in the australian outback in which robert pattinsons character sits in the cab of a truck at night listening to the radio play keri hilsons hit pretty girl rock the night is black and the radio tinny and softly pattinson begins to sing along dont hate me cause im beautiful he sings his voice high and whiny the lyrics muffled by lips that cling to dirty teeth dont hate me cause im beautiful  its a pivotal moment for rey the slow needy uncertain young man pattinson plays but it also feels like something of a reference point in the career of the actor himself a small reminder for the audience of just how far he has run from his days as the prettyboy hollywood pinup  the pattinson who walks into our interview this morning seems to play a similar trick pointing out two steps into the room that the hotel carpet looks like a magic eye picture and indeed it does  a bold blurry pattern in stripes of cream and black but pattinsons remark also serves to shifts attention neatly away from himself as if he is weary of being the centre of it the face that everyone stares at  pattinson was 22 when he was first cast as edward cullen in the twilight saga the fivepart movie adaptation of stephanie meyers bestselling teen vampire novels overnight he became one of hollywoods most adored young stars pursued wherever he went by paparazzi and screaming fans he was named the most handsome man in the world by vanity fair and one of the 100 most influential people by time amid all the fuss and the madness he embarked upon a tortuous relationship with his costar kristen stewart that meant the young couple were rarely out of the gossip pages  he is 28 now the final twilight instalment done the stewart romance finished he is finally cutting a dash as a serious actor  early leadingman roles remember me water for elephants have given way to more challenging characters  he earned impressive reviews for his portrayal of a young billionaire in david cronenbergs adaptation of don delillos cosmopolis and will soon be seen in another cronenberg project maps to the stars  as well as starring alongside nicole kidman in the gertrude bell biopic queen of the desert  but for now he is rooted in michôds the rover a brilliantly dark story of a loner guy pearce in pursuit of a gang of ramshackle crooks who have stolen his car en route he acquires rey pattinson the brother of one of the thieves whom they had left for dead at the scene of a botched robbery and together they chug through the australian desert now a glowering lawless land 10 years after a global economic collapse  i just thought it was strikingly original pattinson says of first reading michôds script even in the way it looked on the page  davids got a very specific way of writing dialogue its very functional the writings very harsh its savage but it didnt feel just stylised writing  it was emotional as well it just seemed so natural compared to something like no country for old men i always felt that was more like film writing and this didnt really feel like a film script  it felt like a dream  pattinson has a very particular way of speaking he will talk softly intently about subjects you sense mean a great deal to him  michôds writing for instance or the craft of acting  only to then sweep it to one side with a flourishing it was crazy or a burst of wheezy slightly wild laughter it gives the impression of someone who has not quite yet settled into his skin  he had to audition for the rover  a process he loathes im quite good at doing meetings he says if im just meeting someone about a job im like a dog especially if my agents said to me a lot of people want this job then im like oh yeah then i will do anything to get it whats his technique i dont know i just become a bullshit artist he laughs thats when i start acting im really much better at doing it when the cameras arent rolling  but auditions petrify him he has spoken of the good 45 minutes of neuroses he has to suffer before any audition can ever really begin i just cant  i literally cant do it he tries to explain its just me looking uncomfortable trying to put on an american accent  or sitting in the corner making myself throw up and punching myself in the face what helps get him past the neuroses what happens after those excruciating 45 minutes that helps him perform just that you think that someone actually believes you can do something he says that makes me sound like such an idiot its crazy  but the joys of acting still outweigh these moments  for whatever reason i think theres something profoundly satisfying about being able to watch something youve done afterwards or to just do a scene and feel like oh i just had an outofbody experience for a second  he pauses just for one second he says gently and generally people dont even notice it feels literally like youve been asleep for a second he recalls such a moment while shooting this film its not the biggest scene its not even in the movie it was the rehearsal and me and guy had just been going so nuts  wed been out in the desert and wed become like crazy homeless people and i turned around and looked at him and just realised actually were not acting any more he laughs and why did that feel so good its so weird  its easy to assume that being tethered to the longrunning twilight saga held him back from experiencing such moments from growing as an actor but he argues that the role required more resources than most i think twilights probably the hardest part ive done he says because to do it for five movies its really hard to think of stuff thats maybe not boring especially if you dont die because whats the drama youre not scared of anything and thats the whole essence of drama life and death  pattinson was born and raised in london but many of his film roles have required an us accent in the rover rey is from the american south and like many has relocated to australia in search of work in the mines it was the voice he says that led him into the character  he recalls losing my mind during his first day on set it just didnt feel right for ages he says and then there was this one little thing  i had this makeup on my teeth and it kept rubbing off all the time it was really putting me off  it meant i had to keep redoing scenes so i started trying to do this thing where i covered my teeth with my lips and it changes your voice a little bit but i thought oh thats really cool and after that i started speaking like that ouhhggghhh  he replicates the style and then laughs its so silly its so stupid i was just kind of making the accent up i dont even know what state it is really  but for pattinson having the opportunity to play a grubbytoothed mumbler from an unidentified corner of the american south proved liberating as did the fact that his character plays second fiddle to that of pearce theres something about rey and theres something about not having to drive the story forward he explains you can just be the condiment its really kind of freeing just being the sidekick weirdo  he is full of praise for pearce for his physicality and his ability to transform himself for the role he speaks of how for much of their time on set he thought pearce to be physically bigger and of his strange surprise when filming ended to find him not only cleanshaven but also somehow reduced in stature  and i liked seeing that guy even after having done tons and tons of movies is still scared he adds ive worked with some actors who having done so many movies they just know what theyre gonna do no matter what i would be doing in a scene they would have practised their part in a mirror already and that was it whereas guy is really trying to find it still so that was why it was more fun  because neither of us really knew what the movie was about when we started but hes not afraid to let it happen and theres very few actors whove been doing it as long as he has that still approach it like that that still have that element of danger  how did they find out what the movie was about i think its about the feel pattinson says i think after i did cosmopolis i realised that trying to psychoanalyse parts and trying to be all clever about it  well it only really started with actors in the 50s and for thousands of years before that it was just about voice and using your body as a performance instrument  he gives a faintly embarrassed laugh so i generally think whatever feels nice its probably right  what felt nice in this role was the language he says it was all the little speech patterns it was like a song  if youre singing a song in a certain way youre not trying to make it sound sad or something it just is he frowns i keep trying to do that in movies but its really difficult trying to find scripts that allow for it that mean you dont have to hit specific thematic beats  occasionally he tries to write something himself i was trying to write a play the other day and i showed it to my assistant and didnt quite realise how bad it was he laughs and laughs i was writing it totally by myself in the middle of the night thinking this is how you do it you just stay up all night and keep writing she came in the next morning and id been up all night writing i said to her you have to read this its amazing he could tell it was perhaps not he says from her facial expressions as she read and then she said its not in english  and half the time you havent even put the character names in so its just a stream of consciousness  but he would like to be in a play he says something in a really small theatre i dont think i could do something on broadway  but id quite like to do something kind of shocking  he likes being shocking he says and his next role is satisfyingly so starring alongside robert de niro in olivier assayass idols eye he will play a smalltime criminal caught up with the chicago mafia my character is this slightly delusional lost child he says everyone always glamorises criminals  it feels inevitable in movies  but in this its really not glamorised it is quite dense its really serious very political  i think of something he told me earlier about the ways in which he believes twilight has influenced his career and of how he wagers that most cinema audiences have judged him before he has uttered a single line on the screen i pictured his frustration the effort of forever trying to shake off that famous role but on the contrary he explained he enjoys the possibilities that tension brings  its kind of fun he said because people have preconceived ideas about you and sometimes it affords you the opportunity to shock people more

248k shares share this story  republican nominee donald trumps ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the rightwing in america really is when kathy miller told reporters that racism in america didnt exist until president obama i dont think there was any racism until obama got elected we never had problems like this  now with the people with the guns and shooting up neighborhoods and not being responsible citizens thats a big change and i think thats the philosophy that obama has perpetuated on america growing up as a kid there was no racism believe me we were just all kids going to school  this perfectly illustrates how the rightwing digs their mental bogs of ignorance  blame obama for literally everything absolve selfraceidentity group of all responsibility then construct pleasant fantasy  supporting her candidates constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the africanamerican community she then went on to say that black americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that if youre black and you havent been successful in the last 50 years its your own fault youve had every opportunity it was given to you youve had the same schools everybody else went to you had benefits to go to college that white kids didnt have you had all the advantages and didnt take advantage of it its not our fault certainly  to put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism she then felt the need to add that the black lives matter movement is a stupid waste of time and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black americans were raised  in one fell swoop this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery segregation and the jim crow era the widespread lynchings of black americans by radical christian terrorist organizations like the ku klux klan the ghettoization of the inner cities mass incarceration and the war on drugs and the wholesale slaughter of black americans by law enforcement from the record instead she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface  she is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the american population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality when the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people she replied i dont care its the truth  the trump campaign in a nutshell ladies and gentlemen  update kathy miller has resigned her from her position with the trump campaign and has issued an apology it should be noted the trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season  watch it here  her remarks begin at 440  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

lindsay lohan talks drugs booze rehab sex  just days before checking into courtordered rehab last week the actress spoke extensively to piers morgan in an article for londons daily mail newspaper which published it in this sundays edition  shes spent more than 250 days in rehab and another trip is pointless she said in the daily mail story instead she should be allowed to go abroad to different countries and work with children  lohans life and career ran off the rails starting in her disastrous year of 2007 when she was twice convicted of drunken driving once for cocaine use made three trips to rehab and served an 84minute jail stay her arrests were totally irresponsible  a stupid mistake she said  and from then on the press were on me all the time lohan said it was the first time id taken drugs i was out in a club with people i shouldnt have been with and took cocaine and got in the car it was so stupid  her first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie she told morgan  she voluntary checked into the wonderland center in los angeles while she was shooting i know who killed me in january 2007  i was having really bad nightmares and the movie was pretty traumatizing lohan said so i stayed in a facility so i could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day because it was overwhelming but i would leave every day and just sleep there at night i liked that it was kind of like having my own livein therapist because i was having crazy nightmares and i was having aa meetings on set and stuff it really helped  she had been drinking for less than a year at that point lohan said she stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at 17 when her mother made her sleep with vomit still on me so id understand how it felt she said i was too scared  she was a good teenager she said my friends and i would actually pretend to be drunk she said and it was more fun i never rebelled against my parents  i worked hard i was responsible and i didnt go to highschool parties  she doesnt consider herself to be an alcoholic  ive never woken up in the morning and had a drink  but when i was younger i was definitely going out too much and i was drinking too much  lohan considers herself an expert on rehab facilities  ive been courtordered to do it six times she said i could write the book on rehab constantly sending me to rehab is pointless the first few times i was courtordered to rehab it was like a joke like killing time  morgan interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter after arriving at one  which california officials said was unlicensed  she left for the betty ford clinic where she spent her last and longest rehab stay  i look at it as a good thing she said about this rehab visit i can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work but i think there are other things i could do instead of going to a rehab center that would benefit me more the best thing they could do for me would be to make me go abroad to different countries and work with children  if she is not a drug user  she tells morgan she smoked some pot a year ago  or an alcoholic then why would she need rehab morgan asked  this is where it gets hard for me to explain she said i dont think theres anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves i think people want to see me do that they will keep saying the same things about me if i dont i dont think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months  although now confessing to morgan that she used drugs a year ago she told matt lauer on nbcs today show a year ago that that she was clean and sober then for a long time  although she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug lohan said she rarely used it since i dont like it  it reminds me of my dad she said i took it four times in a period from about the age of 20 to 23 and i got caught twice  cocaine made her feel a little too buzzed  it made me feel uncomfortable she told morgan  shes not a junkie she said its the truth ive never taken heroin either never injected myself with anything never done lsd those things all scare me  her drugs of choice are pot obviously and ecstasy she said i liked that ecstasy better than the others morgan reports lohan then giggled  lohan has previously acknowledged having a drug problem though she posted this twitter message in september 2010 just before entering the betty ford clinic for three months substance abuse is a disease which unfortunately doesnt go away over night i am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps  lohan claimed to morgan that shes just misunderstood the constant online tabloid reports of latenight partying which sometimes results in legal issues dont show the real person  ive never been a junkie and never will be she said i just like going out late to clubs with friends and listening to music always have done its not that unusual for girls of 26  she slowed down on her drinking on the advice of an actor lohan said  lohan also talked to morgan about her sexuality  shes straight despite a past relationship with a woman i like boys she said  i know im straight she said i have made out with girls before and i had a relationship with a girl but i think i needed to experience that and i think i was looking for something different  i like being in a relationship with a guy lohan said but theres something just different about it with a woman when i was with samantha i didnt want to leave because i didnt want to be alone it was very toxic  about her father michael lohan he wont change she said i just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is  whenever i do try to bring him back into my life he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage hes been really good and then really crazy my whole life  while she blames the los angeles lifestyle for steering her off course she does point to two hollywood women who have helped her  meryl streep was nice lohan said she just advised me on my acting and what i needed to do differently and she told me i needed to go back to live with my mum for a while  she couldnt move back to new york because at the time her probation requirements which including regular drug testing restricted her to california  the worst possible place i could be she said  jamie lee curtis was very kind to me too she said she also told me to listen to good advice and to get rid of the hangerson  will you see another story about lindsay lohans substance abuse and legal troubles before shes scheduled to get out of rehab in early august what could happen in the betty ford clinic a wellrespected refuge for those needing to get their lives back on track  lohan was accused of assaulting a ford staff member during her last stay in december 2010 although the investigation was suspended on december 24 after the staffer drops charges against lohan  just weeks after her release from there she was again involved in controversy for stealing a necklace from a jewelry store it was that shoplifting conviction that put her on the road to her current rehab visit

beyoncé is pregnant with twins let the conspiracy theories commence  last night the world officially went into meltdown after beyoncé announced she and jay z were expecting twins  with the help of contemporary artist awol erizku queen bee shared her exciting news on social media showing the veiled mothertobe caressing her stomach surrounded by reams of flowers in what has now become the most liked instagram picture of all time  hours later the rumour mill went into overdrive with several conspiracy theories popping up  some of them questioning the timing of her announcement others interpreting the instagram post like its a james joyce epic poem soon there will be more illuminati claims and eventually someone is bound to figure that shes not really pregnant at all and that it was all a ruse  lets have a look at the ideas that have been floated so far  firstly many astute beyhive fans were quick to point out the lemonade star might have given us a hint about her pregnancy via instagram six weeks ago  in a post to instagram before christmas the halo singer shared a slideshow of photos of herself in a suede navy dress and silver antlers which show her in backtoback photos appearing to hold her stomach  in the clip the star can be seen holding up a peace sign  or a number two  before making a heart shape with her hands  while its plausible to believe the singer was simply sharing a message of peace and love to her fans during the festive seasons rumours of the hidden baby announcement have now taken twitter by storm  meanwhile other bey fans are suspicious of the pregnancy news timing  next week beyonce will attend the 59th annual grammy awards  an occasion particularly close to the singers heart given the fact shes amassed 53 nominations and 20 wins over the years  following the unprecedented success of her sixth studio album lemonade which has been nominated for staggering nine grammy awards this year some fans are thinking her welltimed pregnancy announcement to be a clever pr stunt to prevent the news detracting from her awardwinning album and grammy performance  after all when beyonce opened her jacket to confirm her pregnancy following her rendition of love on top at the vmas in 2011 it was this gesture  rather than the song  that naturally caught the worlds attention  it is of course reasonable to assume that one of the most famous women in the world might have put some thought into the perfect way to time her pregnancy announcement to the world  but some of the theories that developed during her first pregnancy reached hilarious levels of fantasy  lets not forget that when ms knowlescarter announced her first pregnancy with the nowfiveyearold blue ivy carter many people believed it to be fake with talk of a shifting stomach during an appearance on an australian television show and suspicion as to the lack of pregnancy photos before the birth  this is the same woman who openly spoke out about the heartache of suffering a miscarriage before falling pregnancy with her first child admitting the sound of her babys heartbeat was the most beautiful music i ever heard in my life during her hbo documentary life is but a dream  while its unknown how far along the singer is in her second pregnancy its fairly traditional for a woman to keep the news hush hush until shes out of the first trimester  perhaps it is also worth considering that beyonce and jay z might have been cautious in sharing the news of their family growing at a time when civil reproductive and womens rights are currently under threat by the trump administration in the us  in all fairness to beyoncé though shes allowed to announce her news whenever she damn pleases really  just look at adele and eva mendes who kept their pregnancies quiet until the actual births making a statement about the fact that even though celebrities are in the public eye they and their families are not public property  some conspiracy theories can be quite fun admittedly mostly when they are completely inconceivable or bizarre but for now lets focus on the fact queen bee is about to welcome two of the coolest kids to the planet

ellen degeneres talks feelings fun and finding dory  ellen degeneres is a lot like the cartoon fish she gives life to in disneypixars finding dory opening june 17 much like dory whom we met in the hit 2003 movie finding nemo degeneres 58 is undaunted kind strong and loving swimming on despite the obstacles in her way but unlike dory whose amnesia causes her to remember almost nothing degeneres remembers a whole lot  the native of metairie louisiana hasnt forgotten the slow road to fame in the 1990s and how her first primetime comedy series ellen was abandoned by advertisers and the tv network when it flopped capsized in part by backlash and negative response to her coming out as tvs highestprofile lesbian like dory she swam on she went back to doing standup comedy created her own afternoontv talk show and hosted the emmys grammys and the academy awardstwice  in 2008 degeneres married australian actressmodel portia de rossi 43 both vegans they share a passion for animal rights environmental causes and renovating houses parades dotson rader met with degeneres in her office on the back lot of the tv studio complex in burbank california where the ellen degeneres show has been produced for 13 years  what was your childhood like was it fun  i grew up in a very conservative home my father was a first reader in the christian science church which is similar to being a preacher there was no drinking smoking or cursing i didnt see deep emotion from my parents it was all very polite and very surface i never knew how anybody was feeling because of that religion everything was fine all the time  isnt it dishonest to pretend youre happy when youre really angry  exactly i never saw anyone angryso when i was 13 and my parents divorced it was a huge surprise to me because i was told everything was fine it was very confusing thats not a healthy way to grow up it was very hard to express yourself a kid should be told that you can have feelings i have a lot of feelings you can feel sad and angry and hurt but the only feeling that was approved of is happinessthat was it how can you have happiness when youre not honest  how did that emotional repression affect you  as a young girl i noticed things a lot more i started seeing that things werent completely as everyone said they were i noticed everything because i had to after my parents divorced at 13 i sort of became the parent taking care of my mother  did that experience influence your comedy  i think my comedy came from observing little details in life what is most important are the details not the broad strokes but noticing whats in between one of my first jokes was the fact that when somebody tastes something disgusting they always want you to taste it too like this is disgustingtaste it and people do  why could you see what others never saw  because i was very tender i was very sensitive and i still am i never want to hurt anybody i want to make people laugh i didnt think it was ever funny to make fun of people theres so much to laugh at without it being at someone elses expense  you end each tv show by telling your viewers to be kind to each other why is kindness so important to you  because ive been treated in a way that has not been kind respectful or considerate i learned compassion from having experienced some bad stuff  after your parents divorced you stayed alone with your mom in new orleans  yes my mother was going through a hard time she dated lots of really horrible men and had bad experiences she went from being my mother to being somebody i was watching date men at 13 its a weird thing then she remarried and had breast cancer right away a really tough thing for her i had to make her laugh my comedy started from me trying to make her happy it felt really good to have power to make people happy thats my talent not that i thought id make money from it  you have an older brother vance what happened to him  he left angry he was 17 he didnt want to live with either parent he was in a band now were very very close hes great he is very talented and works with my production company  you went to the university of new orleans for less than a semester and dropped out why  school just was not interesting to me  before ellen was ellen do you remember her 10 best tv appearances  were you surprised when abc abruptly canceled your hit sitcom after your character came out  it was a sucker punch i didnt expect it i knew that there was a big chance that this was the end of my career but im grateful for it i got to start over again and create this talk show there are people who dont know about the sitcoms or my standup comedy they think im just a talk show host thats fine with me  on your talk show everything is positive despite what may be happening thats bad in the real world say in politics  i dont do political humor i never have trump is being attacked by everybody because its an easy thing to do stephen colbert goes after him every night and so does jimmy fallon jimmy kimmel a lot of people do i dont i dont want to make fun of anybody its not who i am  get a peek at ellens quirky design style in her new book home  your show seems unrelentingly happy it is a happy show on purpose i represent happiness to a lot of people i want to keep myself as open and as nonjudgmental as possible before the show was picked up i think a lot of station managers thought i would have an agenda to try to somehow turn the world gay people did worry our only agenda is to make people feel good its an hour of joy  your audience squeals with excited delight a lot there are people from all over the world who wait three years for tickets i was in dubai and this woman said shed been trying to get tickets for five years thats why i created the room for leftover people who cant get in tom hanks named it the riff raff room  you live a very public life with a lot of pressures among them rumors of marital problems with your wife portia i dont pay attention to rumors but weve been followed recently by the paparazzi and we found out its because theres a story out there that were getting divorced we dont know why were together all the time we genuinely love each other her happiness is my happiness and vice versa true love is caring more about the other persons happiness than your own

last week i wrote an article titled donald trumps amazing week which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and never trumpers everywhere guess what this past week has been even better for the 2016 republican nominee for president the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago well no one is laughing anymore  the latest round of polls shows that the support for the trump presidency is growing rapidly the latest fox news poll which was taken from september 1114 shows donald trump polling at 46 a onepoint lead over democratic nominee hillary clinton at 45 the la timesusc poll taken from september 915 shows trump at 47 with a sixpoint lead over clinton at 41 the gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states the suffolk university poll which was taken from september 1214 shows trump at 42 leading by 3 points with clinton at 39 the cnnorc poll which was taken september 712 shows trump with a 4point lead over clinton in florida clinton still has about a 35 point lead over trump in other key battleground states including pennsylvania and michigan but those gaps are getting narrower every day other states such as nevada and new hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for clinton have moved to the toss up state category  donald trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform his childcare plan at a speech in aston pa just outside of philadelphia spearheaded by his daughter ivanka trump trumps childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum the plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers this benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program lower income families will also benefit from the plans offering of childcare rebates through the earned income tax credit eitc program up to 1200 per year middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns families will also have the ability to establish dependent care savings accounts dcsas to put money aside tax free for childcare low income families will receive a 50 match of the first 1000 deposited per year generating up to an additional 500 per eligible family per year dcsas can be applied to pay for childcare after school enrichment programs and school choice families can also use the funds in a dcsa to care for an elderly parents expenses including in home nursing and longterm care finally trumps childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stayathome parents effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parents decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent  donald trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the economic club of new york which includes some of new yorks most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance trumps excellent week continued with his visit to the dr oz show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history other than carrying an extra 1520 pounds trump appears to be in excellent health of course trumps unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about hillary clintons health following her fainting at last weeks september 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia again only donald trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event well it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on the dr oz show a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers during the one hour program the discussion of trumps health was followed by the appearance of ivanka trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women so yes somehow all this concern about hillary clintons health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for donald trump  trump followed up the dr oz interview with a visit to the tonight show with jimmy fallon during the visit trump permitted the late night comedian to do something unpresidential that is to say he told fallon that he could mess up his hair while most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely preplanned the fact that trump said yes to the display speaks volumes he demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken furthermore the tonight show is popular with democrats and millennials of all political persuasions once again trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the trump train oh and one more thing by letting jimmy fallon touch his hair on national television trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his however small its another check mark in the honesty and transparency box  now if all of this was not enough donald trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in

jake gyllenhaal is not here for taylor swift questions  left by mike pontwireimage right from gc images both from getty images  in 2010 famously private jake gyllenhaal and taylor swift dated nearly a decade later hes shutting down questions about it in interviewsthis time in the guardian  at the time gyllenhaal was nine years her seniora minor scandalbut the relationship only lasted three months it would have turned into one of the smoldering ember piles of forgotten celebrity relationships that dot the tabloid landscape if not for that maplelatte photo and red the song swift allegedly wrote about gyllenhaal which initiated him into a sort of club a group of men that have inspired swift songs  now nearly seven years later in the year of our lord 2017 the actor has to contend with the unhappy reality of answering questions about his time with swift call it club dues made payable to interviewers  gyllenhaal has spoken about the relationship without giving too much away before notably in 2015 on howard stern but hes no longer abiding those questions writer tim jonze for the the guardian found that out in an interview which was ostensibly about the actors new movie life heres the tensest part of the exchange as its rendered by jonze  for someone so intensely private wasnt it playing with fire a little to start dating taylor swift asking this proves to be a mistake i think when youre in a relationship you are constantly scrutinised your friends are scrutinised but  he trails off and stares at me ramping up the intensity of his eyes like hes done in so many roles but what gyllenhaal just continues to stare then he performs an exaggerated shrug so er did he listen to any of the many songs rumored to be about him more silence the atmosphere has become uncomfortably tense would he like to move on i would love to not talk about my personal life i dont think this is massively oh really you dont he asks  are you shivering yet put on another layer because later gyllenhaal recounts his time meeting obama and manages to bring it back to the question obama told me you have a job as an artist to help people through difficult times to illuminate things through art he said thats your job and my parents have always said that too and im sure you know it because you seem like a very smart person who has done their research particularly into tabloid research which is obviously the most important of all research  and thats not it for the siberian tundra of an actor still on politics gyllenhaal says so its an irony to me when people say an entertainer or actor should not be political because its very easy to sideline people and for instance ask about past relationships or things that i believe are meant to be private  gyllenhaal is the iceberg and jonze the titanic completely sunk by gyllenhaals final act muttering to a handler its always the last interview of the day weve all learned a valuable lesson too gyllenhaals life is fair game but his life is not  vanity fair has reached out to gyllenhaal for comment

on monday donald trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching ahmad khan rahami who was responsible for the saturday bombing in new york city  this would have normally been a nice gesture if it hadnt been a contradiction of something trump had said just a few minutes before fortunately whenever trump flipflops or lies americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsht via social media  and they didnt hesitate to remind trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for rahamis capture hed dissed the nypd for allowing political correctness to interfere with catching terrorists among the first to point this out was msnbcs christopher hayes who tweeted  hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment trump had made on fox and friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers in which he said  you know our police are amazing our local police they know who a lot of these people are they are afraid to do anything about it because they dont want to be accused of profiling and they dont want to be accused of all sorts of things  yup  trump had accused the nypd of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame other people recognized this epic fail as well and blasted the republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and twofaced  this tweet was particularly funny and im sure there will be some backlash for trump to deal with  throughout his presidential campaign trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than african american police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a law and order candidate but thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists trump has probably just ruined a year of prolaw enforcement campaigning  featured image via spencer platt  getty images

ive watched every presidential debate ever broadcast including the littleremembered john f kennedyhubert humphrey contest just before the 1960 west virginia primary and for nearly 40 years ive analyzed how candidates win and lose them but when i ask myself what kind of strategy i would devise for hillary clinton tonight against donald trump im pretty much baffled  the problem is not just the unpredictable to put it mildly nature of her opponent will trump be lowkey and calm will he attack her honesty will he turn on lester holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage the problem is that almost all of hillary clintons strengths in this strange election year can so easily be turned into her weaknessesespecially her vast experience in government the more she emphasizes her qualifications the more trump is likely to respond with some version of youve been at the center of power for 25 years then youre one of those whos created the mess were in so reciting her work with foreign leaders for example and contrasting it with trumps utter lack of grounding in the world doesnt seem to be promising  story continued below  indeed this debate offers trump the chance to perform what ive called political judoturning an opponents strength against her yes mrs clinton your experience helped drag us into iraq and turned syria libya the whole middle east into a staging ground for isis maybe thats why your husbands cia director and bobby kennedys chief speechwriter are backing me  further theres a sensea highly limited sensein which trump is in something like the position ronald reagan was in back in 1980 among collegeeducated whites who have resisted him so far his task is to use the debates to say im a reasonable person who knows whats gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it its a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want carter but needed reassurance about reagan which they got there is a limit to this analogy because for all of her difficulties clinton is in a much stronger position than president carter was  by contrast how does she try to gain strength on the issue of honest and trustworthy if trump can be convinced by his handlersassuming they existto avoid overkill here all he has to do is to note what the fbi director or the new york times editorial page has said she can of course cite chapter and verse on trumpbankruptcies trump university david farentholds expose of his charities in the washington postbut those issues are illsuited i think to a facetoface debate one of her problems longstanding is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at trumpand hes still standing  does any of this mean that clinton is facing doom monday night no it does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and dont do based on a halfcentury or so of history  the focus is on momentsbut theyre not always the key  ask any political journalist to recite the history of debates and it would go something like this  nixon looked pale and drawn ford prematurely liberated poland from soviet control reagan said to carter there you go again then asked americans are you better off four years later he was incoherent but then recovered by joking about mondales youth and inexperience dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wifes rape and murder lloyd bentsen told dan quayle was no jack kennedy george hw bush looked at his watch al gore stalked george w bush who froze him with a nod  these are the moments that are played over and over again in the runup to debates they illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip the gaffe the thrust the parry that can sum up 90 minutes its why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy memorable lineszingersto win the attention and admiration of the audience its also why the late political journalist lars eriknelson scornfully said of his colleagues youve all become theater critics  but in fact this view of debates is not the whole story sometimes its the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails look back at the first romneyobama debate in 2012 there was no one exchange no one obama stumble or romney answer that provided the aha moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox it was rather obamas petulant defensive sometimes indifferent answers that made even the presidents most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten  the presence of trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a moment unlike any in debate history thats clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for but it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say he seemed pretty reasonable or she knows what shes talking about and he doesnt this has special relevance for clinton who as her longtime friend and onetime aide patti solisdoyle observed always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth a sustained relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a trump whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a teleprompter is questionable  there are three debates not oneand that can matter a whole lot  one key reason why the 1980 reagancarter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two carter had refused to debate with thirdparty candidate john anderson so reagan faced off against anderson on september 21st when the independent fell below the polling threshold carter and reagan met for the first and last time on october 28thbarely a week before the election  every other time there have been three debates which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut thats what happened with reagan in 1984 and with george w bush in 2004 its also what happened last time out when obama emerged from his daze and outperformed romney in their two other meetings  here i think is an opening for clintonespecially in the town hall meetings where she should be able to turn a questionand they are usually very lame what can you do for my daughter questionsinto answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals and of trumps astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next the danger for her is channeling her inner al gore who challenged bushs commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding what about dingellnorwood the opportunity for her is to arguefrom experiencethat what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better further the town meeting formatwith dozens of real people as participantsmakes the resort to personal insults highly risky  trump is not the only one who can deploy political judo  the potential for trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo it came in 1992 when independent ross perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience  well he said theyve got a point i dont have any experience in running up a 4 trillion debt i dont have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else i dont have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world the most violent crimeridden society in the industrialized world  judo however can cut both ways theres a clear opening for clinton if trump were to boast of his leadership skills and his business success  well you might be successful donald but we really dont know because youre the first presidential candidate ever who wont show us his taxes but you know you should look at the business leaders who support me mike bloomberg whos worth four times what you claim to be worth and who didnt start with millions from his father says youre a con a fake so does marc cuban who built his success from the ground up but i do have to admityoure way way ahead of them in unpaid workers fleeced contractors and lawsuits  debates are not decisive  one last note its easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake monday night a lot of postelection narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story reagan recovered from his first debategaffe and went onto win a landslide obama was far more effective in the later debates and was reelected but is correlation really causation maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with reagan winning 49 states maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in obamas clear if modest popular vote victory  in their influential 2013 book the gamble political scientists john h sides and lynn vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates gaffes and other gamechangers with realtime public opinion measurements what they found was that even a dramatic event like romneys first debate performance had a relative small and relatively shortlived impact compared to the fundamentalseconomic performance and the evergrowing impact of a polarized electoratethe stuff of which a hundred overwrought postdebate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance  of course this cycle the fundamentals point to a very close race so youll probably want to tune in anyway  jeff greenfield is a fivetime emmywinning network television analyst and author

sarah jessica parker puts rumors of feud with kim cattrall to rest with one birthday instagram  although we couldnt help but wonder if carrie bradshaw would understand instagram  yesterday was kim cattralls 60th birthday she received plenty of good tidings from various news outlets and other actors but the main question on everybodys lips was whether her sex and the city costar would express her own well wishes the answer was yes sarah jessica parker the carrie bradshaw to cattralls samantha jones took to instagram to very publicly declare that she was sending cattrall love and all her very best on this cattralls special day  your ol pal fellow mischief maker and sister sj parker signed her note sister didnt really need to go in quotes but point made for years there have been rumors of a feud between the two costars on the set of both the sex and the city tv show as well as the two films the tv show begat this instagram finally put those rumors to bed  the cause of the fight is usually pinned to money the ladies reportedly had a big falling out in the shows final season when parker was paid considerably more than cattrall on the hbo series us weekly notes us reports that their alleged disagreement over money might have caused additional problems with production on the sex and the city films  parker and cattrall have denied rumors of a falling out and feud for years in november 2009 parker told elle i dont think anybody wants to believe that i love kim i adore her i wouldnt have done the movie without her cattrall in turn told the magazine she shines and she allows you to shine as well  cattrall was still being asked about the supposed beef in a january 2010 interview with the daily mail i think sarah was right people dont want to believe that we get on they have too much invested in the idea of two strong successful women fighting with each other it makes for juicy gossip and copy the truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is where near as newsworthy i think sarah is fantastic    she and i are sick of this its exhausting talking about it and a real bore  well its been six years since that interview now we have social media which allows us to get words and images straight from celebrities mouths with no publication acting as a middle man to possibly filter or alter their quotes so behold an image of kim cattrall posted by sarah jessica parker on her birthday look at the caption in which parker calls cattrall a beauty and wishes her joy and an adventurefilled year  its just like carrie said friendships never go out of style or like samantha said i support you and these bitches need to be put in their places

sen mitch mcconnell said a filed spending measure is the result of many many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle  getty mcconnell plays hardball in spending fight  mitch mcconnell is playing hardball  forcing democrats into a takeitorleaveit position on a mustpass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month  with spending negotiations still stymied at the capitol mcconnell filed a new shortterm government spending measure thursday that concedes key priorities to democrats  yet still isnt enough to get the minority party on board  story continued below  gone is the socalled icann provision an internetdomain issue that had become a top priority for sen ted cruz rtexas and other gop senators and just got the seal of endorsement from gop nominee donald trump it also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in june  the new spending measure mcconnell filed thursday  which funds the government until dec 9  also includes language already worked out between democrats and republicans to deal with additional funding for the zika virus epidemic a procedural vote on the measure is slated for tuesday afternoon and mcconnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option  there have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution so thats what ive just offered mcconnell said its the result of many many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle  but democrats who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable republicans leave washington say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as louisiana west virginia and maryland it doesnt include money for the longrunning water crisis in flint michigan  to put louisiana in without flint is like waving a red flag i dont get it said new york sen chuck schumer the thirdranking senate democrat i havent counted votes but our caucus isnt going to like having louisiana and not michigan  it also does not remove language that prohibits the securities and exchange commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending that is current law but democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations democrats also floated a provision related to the exportimport bank that would have restored the banks full financing authority but that was not included in the spending measure mcconnell filed thursday that exim provision was also important for some republicans south carolina sen lindsey graham said he would vote against the shortterm funding bill because that language was excluded  the president does not believe that a shortterm budget measure that only exists because congress hasnt done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law white house press secretary josh earnest said thursday while slamming republicans for their opposition to the exim bank  yet mcconnells proposal is also starting to drive a rift through democrats while some leading senate democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure other democrats began to side with republicans democratic sen bill nelson whose home state of florida has been the nations epicenter of the zika crisis said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside 11 billion to combat zika with no political riders  while i support the people of flint my priority is the people of florida nelson said  senate minority leader harry reid dnev signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before mcconnell went to the floor to unveil it thursday afternoon  were in no hurry to go anyplace ok we have all a lot of time reid told reporters ive talked with house minority leader nancy pelosi shes not going to agree to this the president is not going to agree to this its really unfair to the american people  during her weekly news conference earlier thursday pelosi said the legislation in my view is not even worthy of a counter it falls very short  maryland sen barbara mikulski the top democratic appropriator charged mcconnell with filing a republicanonly bill and said democrats would not support the legislation although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it  house speaker paul ryan for his part is trying to project an air of calm telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want low drama in order to solve the government funding impasse but cruz is pressuring house lawmakers to fight on behalf of the internet domain provision that he championed  i am grateful for my senate colleagues vigorous support during this debate cruz said in a statement i encourage my colleagues in the house to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the internet  heather caygle louis nelson burgess everett and ashley gold contributed to this report  authors

jrod jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez on love beauty and redemption  despite the surreal fameand baggagecarried by jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez their relationship makes perfect sense both started from modest backgrounds hit the big time fast and had to battle their own demons to survive the new couple discuss everything from their nerveracking first date to the reveals that forged their bond  despite the surreal fameand baggagecarried by jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez their relationship makes perfect sense both started from modest backgrounds hit the big time fast and had to battle their own demons to survive the new couple discuss everything from their nerveracking first date to the reveals that forged their bond  despite the surreal fameand baggagecarried by jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez their relationship makes perfect sense both started from modest backgrounds hit the big time fast and had to battle their own demons to survive the new couple discuss everything from their nerveracking first date to the reveals that forged their bond  it was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldnt normally do says jennifer lopez explaining how she and retired yankee superstar alex rodriguez who made their redcarpet debut as a couple last spring at the met gala came to be a modern marilyn monroe and joe dimaggiothat is if monroe and dimaggio had been happy highly functional fortysomethings who had apparently done battle with their demons and emerged the victors it was last winter as she was having lunch in beverly hills that she saw rodriguez walk by i almost yelled out alex but i am the shyest person when it comes to things like that she says when she went outside he was still there facing away from her i could literally just have walked away she says but i walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say hey i had just come from a promo for my show shades of blue in which she plays nypd detective harlee santos so im dressed like my character like a boytimberlands jeans curly short hair he looks at me i say its jennifer he says you look so beautiful  she and i are sitting on a stone patio at lopezs new house in bel air overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a doublesize swing which she points out is perfect for her nineyearold twins emme and max the house is lightfilled sprawling and warm with woodbeamed ceilings stone walls plush lowslung sofas big pillows bowls filled with cut roses and artwork by collagist peter tunney grattitudǝ one piece spells out its a portmanteau of gratitude and attitude that could define lopez wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater skinny jeans high christian louboutin boots and impressive diamond earrings she is as startlingly beautiful at 48 as she was at 28if not more so we walked into this house and i said this is where i want my kids to grow up  she says you have to imagine your life and what you want to be in it and i imagined we would be very happy here no matter what  happy naturally has turned out differently from what she imagined just hours after rodriguez met her in beverly hills he called her and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later she told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond 12 years earlier her then husband marc anthony had thrown out the first pitch of a new york mets game but the cameras captured lopez and rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes you dont have to say you remember if you dont she told him shea stadium during a subway series he responded just then rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio i was telling her about the tap she says to him but there were two taps he says she turns to me there was another very significant tap on the shoulder she says before we get to that tap we talk about their first date when they met for dinner at the hotel bel air he was sitting there in his white shirt very confident and manly but then he was just so talkative she says i think he thought i was going to be this loud person but im not i just listen so hes talking talking about his plans about how he had just retired from baseball about how he saw himself getting married again all these things you wouldnt normally talk about on a first date i dont know if he thought it was a date i thought it was a date then i knew he was nervous because he asked me if i wanted a drink i said no i dont drink and he asked if i minded if he had one he was nervous and it was really cute i didnt know if it was a date rodriguez says maybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule i went in uneasy not knowing her situation he continues it would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest greatest women in the world especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times rehabbing himself reestablishing himself to folks out there i thought it would be a winwin no matter what then she told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single he says i had to get up and go readjust my thoughts i went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text so im sitting there and hes walking back and i get a text lopez continues it says     she looks significantly at rodriguez you can tell her he says  you look sexy af  she tells me they both laugh and then it took a turn lopez says the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate i laugh thinking shes being metaphorical no really she says the fire alarm went off  but about that other tap this one was metaphorical in august 2016 when rodriguez announced his retirement from baseball with his mother and his daughters natasha and ella in the stands four runs short of 700 home runs he said baseball has a funny way of tapping you on the shoulder when you least expect it and telling you that its the end its a year later and now he says im thinking about one door closing and another opening and if that first door doesnt close well there isnt that second tap rodriguezs story about the tap is a poignant reminder that this isnt just another love story its the story of two people with rich and at times tumultuous pasts which are part of the reason they have a present as a couple we are very much twins he says were both leos were both from new york were both latino and about 20 other things i understand him in a way that i dont think anyone else could and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever she says in his 20s he came into big success with the biggest baseball contract at the time i had a no 1 movie and a no 1 album and made history we both had ups and downs and challenges in our 30s and by our 40s wed both been through so much and more importantly than anything we had both done a lot of work on ourselves lopez whose parents came from puerto rico grew up in the bronx where she shared a bedroom with her two sisters she famously left home at 18 to make it as a dancer and burst on the scene in 1991 as one of the fly girls on foxs in living color the hit comedy series she quickly parlayed her luminous beauty talent and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles including marisa in maid in manhattan which grossed more than 150 million worldwide of their first date lopez recalls i dont know if he thought it was a date i thought it was a date    he was nervous and it was really cute being a movie star wasnt enough for lopez she also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon in 2003 she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with louis vuitton now its odd if youre a celebrity and you dont serve as the spokesperson for a brand says benny medina her longtime manager whom lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace but back then there were plenty of snarky comments in 2013 lopez was granted a star on the hollywood walk of fame and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a billboard icon award her net worth has been estimated at more than 300 million there are people who put their feet in other peoples footsteps says elaine goldsmiththomas who was once lopezs agent and is now a partner in her production company jennifer had no footsteps in front of her so much of the terrain had to be forged  there was a cost lopez learned when you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it almost survive it she says i was the first latin actress to ever make 1 million from a role and you feel oh god i have to do something great all the time there were the inevitable flops most prominently gigli her movie with then boyfriend ben affleck and three failed marriages the last of which was with marc anthony the father of her twins and so her story isnt just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience i was eviscerated she recalls about the press on gigli i lost my sense of self questioned if i belonged in this business thought maybe i did suck at everything and my relationship with affleck selfdestructed in front of the entire world it was a twoyear thing for me until i picked myself up again she has also conquered what was once her biggest fear being alone last august she broke up with dancer casper smart in an effort to learn how shes a seeker says her close friend leah remini the actress and antiscientology activist shes always trying to improve herself her relationships be a better friend a better daughter a better mother a better person shes not closedminded if selfdoubt and selfreflection arent what youd expect from a diva its striking how little diva there is to lopez these days goldsmiththomas who in 2004 was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer recalls that lopez would show up for her chemo appointments she made me very popular on the chemo ward goldsmith says shed bring clothing for everyone from her sweetface line and shed rub my bald head and talk about dreams it was really important to talk about the future because she wanted me to know there was one that girl saved my life rodriguez tells me that lopez is happiest at home in pjs eating chocolatechip cookies with friends she and rodriguez like to talk in terms of reveals the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is an early one for him he says was discovering that lopez was the role model for health and wellness she rarely drinks she tries to get at least eight hours of sleep he adds that helps explain why shes so beautiful shes also been willing to take risks to stay relevant no easy task in a world where female stars are widely believed to have an expiration date in 2010 she agreed to become a judge on american idol which some people derided as a comedown but it worked viewers who knew only an attentiongrabbing siren met a hardworking selfmade empathetic single mother observed forbes no one from my team wanted me to do american idol except benny lopez says but i felt i had something to offer and in the back of my mind i thought maybe people will get to know me a little bit better she adds with reality tv you cant hide who you are you just cant its going to come through  as lopez was becoming jlo so alex rodriguez was becoming arod he was just 18 and the youngest player in the league when he made his debut with the mariners in july 1994 he turned in a series of impressive stats that galvanized the baseball worldlike becoming the youngest player to hit 500 home runs for the 2001 season he was offered a recordbreaking 10year 252 million contract by the texas rangers in 2004 rodriguez was traded to the new york yankees and in 2007 he negotiated another 10year deal like lopez rodriguez is not a child of privilege he too was born in new york city when alex was eight his parents immigrants from the dominican republic moved the family to miami where his mother became a secretary in an immigration office and waited tables at night when he was 10 his dad moved out of the house as with lopez success made him feel not comfort and security but a neardesperate drive to succeed even more and you can see how questions such as can alex rodriguez prove hes worth 252 million would foster that attitude in a young athlete my no 1 goal was to give roi return on investment to owners who believed in me he recalls in 2008 his marriage to cynthia scurtis with whom he had daughters natasha and ella broke up due to his relationship with madonna and his dates with stars from kate hudson to cameron diaz became tabloid fodder plus there were the injuries two major hip surgeries two knee surgeries were both like this lopez says we put so much pressure on ourselves to be great to be the best all the time we understood that about each other when we came together it was oh my god i was the same way  rodriguezs career was ultimately sidelined by the steroid scandal which rocked major league baseball in the mid2000s rodriguez had earlier admitted using performanceenhancing drugs during his time with the rangers but adamantly denied hed continued the practice while with the yankees after a protracted fight with both the yankees and the mlb rodriguez was suspended for an entire seasonone of the largest penalties in baseball historyin early 2014 i was hoping the suspension would be shorter he says today i remember when tony clark the head of our union called me and said its a full seasonits 162 games it was a knife to my ribs rodriguez says he didnt leave his house for seven days i thought id played my last game i grew a beardas much as i can grow itand didnt want to see anyone including my kids i ask him what he learned during that year do you have enough time he asks as he talks lopez nestles into him i started brushing myself off thinking how do i come back into the world he says the year off he realized could give him the chance to heal not just his body but also his mind i felt i could work on myself understand why i kept making mistakes    in a weird way 2014 will be the best thing that ever happened to me it forced a paradigm shift he continues i remember thinking one night    dont know if i told you this babe he says to lopez    in the middle of this craziness i remember its three am four am and like many nights i couldnt sleep im not a crier but im bawling    my pillows are now soaking wet and its the middle of the night and im thinking im the only fucking asshole that gets pocket aces and figures out a way to lose the hand i was so angry at myself so pissed off that it was hard to breathe how did you get through i ask help he says the work i did that was one of the most painful and most rewarding experiences of my life and it continues to this day i tell myself im rounding first base and going to second base its a process  he says he decided to do like rocky balboa to try to make the team as a brokendown 40yearold that didnt have a lot of allies and he succeeded finishing the season with 33 home runs i did that at 40 and 100 percent clean and no one can take that away from me he says it told me everything about who i was when he retired he agreed to stay on as an adviser to yankee owner hal steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players from where i came from that honor is like hitting 800 he says this to lopez was a reveal the most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person she says the hardest times prove who you are thats what i love and admire the most about alex he doesnt let anything beat him he just comes back stronger each believes that if they had been single when they met 12 years ago the relationship wouldnt have worked we had to grow and discover ourselves first she says but it also works for another reason as goldsmiththomas says they werent afraid to dream and they are still dreaming both of them  the next night lopez is performing her smash show all i have in las vegas onstage she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexywith a sense of humorto a festive latininspired segment to an utterly moving testimonial to her children in which she sings lee ann womacks i hope you dance shes an incandescent performer partly because as remini says there is nothing jennifer does that she does halfassed when she is in a project she is in it devouring it arods in the house someone from the audience yells she laughs yes arod is in the house although hes seen the show many times hes still watching every detail he nudges me pointing out a middleaged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to jenny from the block then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch lopezs feet during a segment thats all new york with lopez in a sequined baseball jersey he nudges me again if you look closely youll see what number shes wearing on her jersey he says its 13 his yankee number he says we are very much twins she says i understand him in a way that i dont think anyone else could earlier that day she and rodriguez were in los angeles at the premiere event for this seasons shark tank in which rodriguez will be the first latino shark at a panel where the sharks discussed the show the investor and dallas mavericks owner mark cuban says a lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when alex came in he knew his stuff cold during the redcarpet interviews lopez who is impossibly glamorous in a floorlength tweed coat and aviator sunglasses hangs at the back of the crowd does it feel weird to be in the background i ask noooo she says i like it because im out there enough some people it wouldnt workthey cant stand not being the one in the spotlight but not us  their story is also a merger of business empires lopez who back in 2002way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneurlaunched her fragrance glow by jlo now has a big portfolio of business interests which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings rodriguez seems to slot right into her world from a young age he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income during his suspension year he took investing classes at columbia and marketing classes at the university of miami today arod corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries including real estate sports and wellness media and entertainment i dont have your traditional formal education he says mine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors ive never been afraid to say i dont know can you explain that to me thats echoed by hedgefund billionaire marc lasry who has invested with rodriguez for the last decade whats interesting about alex is that hes a sponge lasry says he really wants to learn another mentor of sorts is mary callahan erdoes the ceo of jp morgan asset  wealth management who met rodriguez around the time that lasry did you might be expecting something different she says but from the first day he had his notebook out hes incredibly curious and serious theres no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance thats true to this day erdoes says whether hes attending a jpmorganhosted conference on brexit or a meeting with a hedgefund manager he sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up asking questions she says rodriguezs innate curiosityabout business about other people about fresh conceptsmakes him stand out in a world where many people lack that trait the real reason people do deals with alex is that they like him and hes smart says lasry  the day after i saw lopezs show in las vegas we meet at one of rodriguezs latest investments which he discovered when he was looking for a place to work out in las vegasmembers of lopezs crew had raved about it called trufusion it offers more than 65 styles of instruction and 35 to 40 daily classes in yoga pilates kettlebell exercises and battlerope workouts in heated rooms last june rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company and now owns the development rights for all of florida president and coo jonathan fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them but alex kills it and immediately afterward hes drilling down asking questions that any privateequity analyst would be asking im warned that the down n dirty bootcamp will be hard and sweaty and it is precisely as advertised at one point confused by the welter of instructionsleft right kettlebell weight sandbagi look over at lopez and roll my eyes in desperation i get confused too she says just watch everyone else during some particularly brutal leg lifts i give up she does not in fact she starts singing at the end were all sitting on our mats drenched in sweat and exhausted journeys dont stop believin is playing  its clear as day that neither of them is hitting pause after vegas shes off to new york where her children are in school and hes off to atlanta where hes filming a pilot for a cnbc reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words gratitude and appreciation when someone offers me a job i thank the lord that i have work and i beg for more work and he adds were really good at reminding each other they begin to tell me a story one in which lopez is in the bath and rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe looking at my face he starts laughing youre like where are you going with this story and is it going to get rrated  but its not rrated not at all he says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room with a book and his feet up in the crisp air lopez breaks in i came out and said what are you doing out here he said living the dream  its clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony i thought wow this person is different lopez says because a lot of people ive met in my life they dont appreciate what theyre doing and how amazing it is    not the greatness of the house but the moment of sitting there with someone you love with a family with healthy kids all over the house are pictures of their four children as one family when i ask rodriguez which of his businesses hes most passionate about he responds without missing a beat my daughters  as we drive from trufusion to a little restaurant in a vegas strip mall called greens and proteins they say that early in their relationship theyd text each other using the hashtag bloodinbloodout after the mexican gangster film that is in some ways about the unbreakable ties of family at the restaurant a few people turn and stare but mostly were ignored probably because no one can quite believe its them hes in workout clothes shes wearing a cropped pink sweatshirt no makeup and has her hair pulled back in a bun when we sit down rodriguez asks what surprised me the most about spending time with them i answer that i was surprised even shocked by their genuine interest in other people but when i walked behind them as they left trufusion their hands were touching and they were talking intently it was normal and natural and easy and thats an even better answer im most surprised to see that out of two often surreal lives they are managing to make one wonderfully real life our essential brief on culture the news and more and its on the house

cleveland  donald trump campaigned wednesday morning in a church in a historically africanamerican community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban america within hours trump was proposing a vast expansion of stopandfrisk policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling  it was just another day in trumps upanddown black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by hillary clinton and the democrats  story continued below  the effort has taken trump from a black church in innercity detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural north carolina where on tuesday evening he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyve ever been in before ever ever ever  on wednesday trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter don king  who dropped the nword before a group of pastors at a cleveland church while extolling trump as a gladiator king hailed trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered  the system is the problem and hes the only gladiator that will take on the system king said  after the church event trump sat for a town hall with fox news host and unabashed supporter sean hannity asked by an audience member what he would do to address violence in the black community trump embraced stopandfrisk  we did it in new york it worked incredibly well trump said  fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that bill de blasio rode to prominence and ultimately the mayors office  but even before trumps stopandfrisk comments he was taking heat for his ever ever ever remark tuesday night  i dont know what mr trump is talking about to say that the situation for africanamericans is worse than its ever been rep john lewis the democratic civil rights icon said wednesday on msnbc is he talking about worse than slavery worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination  when we couldnt take a seat at the lunch counter and be served worse than being denied the right to register to vote to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities  trumps polling numbers among africanamerican voters have been dismal  in the low single digits  and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters particularly women and those in the suburbs that he is not racist trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks  what do you have to lose he says  to largely white audiences  at the new spirit revival center in cleveland trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd  seated to trumps right was mike pence his softspoken running mate to his left outspoken longtime attorney michael cohen behind him king theres only one trump said former presidential rival ben carson tough retired lt gen michael flynn a tough general and former apprentice star omarosa manigault a wonderful woman who has helped with trumps black outreach  im different from a lot of republicans frankly trump said from the pulpit  trump who has called himself the law and order candidate criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in oklahoma last week trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been choking in the fatal shooting trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents  now did she get scared was she choking what happened but maybe people like that people that choke people that do that maybe they cant be doing what theyre doing ok  king whom top gop officials had pushed not to speak at the republican national convention due to a past manslaughter conviction was given the prime slot of introducing trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference  king clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of israel and the united states argued repeatedly that the system had oppressed minorities and women and only trump can upend it entirely  every white woman should cast a vote for donald trump said king who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of africanamericans  i told michael jackson i said if youre poor youre a poor negro  i would use the nword  but if you rich you are a rich negro if you are intelligent intellectual youre an intellectual negro if youre a dancing and sliding and gliding n i mean negro king said  when trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later he grinned ah theres only one don king  before king cohen trumps attorney used his time at the church to slash at the disgusting liberal mainstream media and its casting of trump as a racist  the word of the 2016 election has somehow become racist cohen complained ive lost count as to how many times the disgusting liberal mainstream media have attempted to label mr donald trump as racist a xenophobe and a bigot and lets not forget sexist misogynist narcissist islamophobe antihispanic antisemite demagogue and countless others its disgraceful  cohen said not only is donald trump not a racist he believes that all people are part of one race the human race  trump insisted that democrats had abandoned black voters and that he wouldnt  they come and they take your vote trump said and they say theyll see you in four years    authors

kendall jenner finally talks about those scott disick relationship rumors  kendall jenner and the rest of her famous family are unfortunately pretty used to hearing rumors about themselves and their loved ones over the years theyve accumulated quite a bit of press coverage  some of it factually untrue  which ryan seacrest brought up in a deleted scene from this past sundays kuwtk 10 year special via e  a lot of people read the tabloids some rely on the tabloids to get pretty inaccurate information some of those headlines pretty darn ridiculous ryan said per e  he then went on to tell the family that they would be shown some of the most outrageous stories that have been published and would be given the opportunity to respond and say whether or not they were true  they then brought up a headline about kendall jenner and scott disick that read kendall how scott seduced me it referenced the ongoing rumor that kendall and her older sister kourtney s former partner and the father of her three children were in a relationship kendall responded i didnt even know that existed i was 19 that was two years ago definitely false though  though we imagined as much the segment went on to address some other rumors such as that kris jenner had a relationship with lamar odom khloé s exhusband and khloé responded by joking that it was actually her who was with scott the whole time  needless to say all of the rumors that were brought up were unfounded but its refreshing to see them maintain their sense of humor about it all after 10 years of dealing with this sort of stuff we imagine they are becoming old pros watch the video for yourself below

the department of homeland securitys inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship  ap photo us mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants  at least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the us were instead granted citizenship the department of homeland securitys inspector general announced monday  the mistaken citizenships were granted the department of homeland security explained in a press release because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the fbis fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported  story continued below  the discovery was made by the department of homeland securitys office of inspector general which released a report monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships the department of homeland securitys records are incomplete the release said because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized the fbis records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau  the inspector generals report specified that those granted citizenship were only potentially ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly a statement from the department of homeland security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship  it is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that in some naturalization was not improperly granted department spokesman neema hakim said in the statement other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed  in at least three cases the inspector generals office discovered previouslydeported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for securitysensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels the release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked  this situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of us citizenship through fraud inspector general john roth said to prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications us citizenship and immigration services needs access to these fingerprint records  republican presidential candidate donald trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the us a major part of his presidential platform suggesting during the gop primary that america temporarily ban all muslims from entering the us until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place he has since backed away from that proposal which drew widespread criticism from both parties in favor of a ban on immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism  authors
new york cnn hillary clinton is visiting only two battleground states this week  hardly a sign of confidence at her standing 49 days before the election but an acknowledgement that one task reigns above all preparing for her first facetoface confrontation with donald trump  while she is set to make a quick trip to florida on wednesday after dipping into pennsylvania on monday clinton will devote the lions share of her time huddling with her debate team gaming out how she will confront trump next monday night at hofstra university  the lead clinton enjoyed for months in swing state and national polls has all but evaporated raising the stakes for the first debate the terrorism investigation in new york and new jersey has also added to the urgency of her first meeting with trump which will touch on a litany of economic and security issues  clinton who has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history faces a new challenge with trump she is preparing for trump to confront her on a litany of uncomfortable subjects ranging from her email scandal to bill clintons infidelity to her health  trump showed he was willing to go there tuesday when he tweeted hillary clinton is taking the day off again she needs the rest sleep well hillary  see you at the debate  just watched they cant say that on a debate stagecan they replay more videos  must watch they cant say that on a debate stagecan they 0123  clinton in a radio interview tuesday said she was ready to deal with trumps attacks  i am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as i can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and the bigotry that we have seen coming from my opponent clinton said tuesday on the steve harvey radio show i can take it steve i can take that kind of stuff i have been at this i understand it is a contact sport  to knock trump off his game people advising clinton have been looking for a oneline retort that will be a memorable moment from the contest  clinton has spent hours watching a highlight reel of trumps republican primary debates according to several people familiar with her debate preparation she took notes on what agitated him particularly in his exchanges with rival ted cruz and studied his style  but democrats worry the first debate will give trump a chance to show a more moderate controlled side while millions of people watch possibly for the first time this according to people who have recently talked with the former secretary of state is not lost on clinton  clinton told supporters at an august fundraiser that a friend told her there will be about 100 million people watching and 60 million will be paying attention to the campaign for the first time so dont assume they have followed anything  there will be a lot of new impressions to be made that night clinton said  a team of veteran advisers are leading her debate effort including ron klain who advised obama and karen dunn a longtime lawyer and aide she is not setting up a formal debate camp aides said but intends to be secluded at her home in chappaqua new york in the days leading up to the debate to prepare for her showdown on monday  clinton has also spent considerable time reading briefing books about trumps policy personality and politics including receiving input from tony schwartz who was the coauthor for art of the deal the bestseller about trump  expectations game  clinton aides worry that they cant lower expectations enough ahead of the event  for all his lack of substance trumps showmanship as exreality tv star makes him a formidable debate foe he thrashed his rivals in gop debates brian fallon clintons national press secretary tweeted in august  with her senate contests in 2000 and 2006 along with more than two dozen debates with barack obama in 2008 and nine meetings with bernie sanders in this primary campaign she has stood on a debate stage more than 40 times  trump will not be the first unconventional opponent clinton has faced in a debate clinton allbut ended her 2000 senate race against rick lazio during one of their debates when she stood strong as the republican representative approached her lectern with a piece of paper and demanded she pledge to support stricter campaign finance rules lazios bizarre move was seen as bullying and rude and clinton handily beat him by 12 points in november  just watched debate expectations game is serious business replay more videos  must watch debate expectations game is serious business 0246  her debate last fall against four democratic primary opponents was seen as an outright win for the secretary of state because of the way she handled prickly questions including about whether she is progressive enough for the current bent of the democratic party  im a progressive but im a progressive who likes to get things done clinton said rolling out a line she would later use repeatedly while campaigning  clintons performances have not been without missteps however the former senator from new york cited the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when asked about her ties to wall street a response that aides later said came because their candidate was somewhat flustered by vermont sen bernie sanders attacking her on the issue  which trump will show up  in the last few weeks as clinton has publicly turned to a more affirmative message the former secretary of state has started to focus on how to present her own policies and defend herself against attacks  clinton and her campaign aides have tried to keep a lid on leaks about clintons debate process preferring not to telegraph to the trump campaign how the former secretary of state will go after the businesses magnate  when asked about the debates clinton has tried to laud trumps debating skill while admitting that it is for her to have a strong showing at hofstra  i do not know which donald trump will show up clinton said at an august fundraiser in new york maybe he will try to be presidential and try to convey a gravity that he hasnt done before or will he come in and try to insult and try to score some points

 angelina jolie embraces her innerwitch and innermom  the news that angelina jolies daughter 4yearold vivienne will appear with her mother in the liveaction movie maleficent in which jolie plays the titular sorceress has already sparked a predictable array of nepotism jokes and while im sure vivienne got a massive legup because of who her parents are theres also something awfully fun about seeing jolie play both with her public image as a practitioner of the dark arts and her private life as a mom    for more than a decade jolie has been saddled with a witchy reputation one that wasnt based in hollywood diva behavior but in small acts that assumed great proportions in the public mind when she married costar jonny lee miller jolie took her vows in a tshirt emblazoned with his name written in her own blood and after she and actor billy bob thornton wed they famously wore matching necklaces with vials of each others blood gossips tutted about a smooch jolie laid on her brother at the academy awards and the actress ran through the list of tabloidsating provocations dating actress jenny shimizu discussing her history of selfmutilation comfortably in public and talking about bdsm with a fluency that would set el james ascribbling    taken together all of the above combined to paint a portrait of a powerfully alluring woman with deep uncertainties about herself and her choices when brad pitt divorced jennifer anniston to be with jolie now his fiancee after seven years and five children together the romance provided a narrative that seemed to solidify jolies public image in the pages of gossip rags she was an enchantress a creature of blood and sex qualities never entirely erased by her eventual transformation into mother of three children by pitt and three others by adoption  which is why its so awesome that jolie is starring in a childrens movies as a witch rather than as a princess or a warrior witches may bear the weight of public disapproval but the hero often needs them at the beginning of the journey and the adventure often involves the hero learning to see the world with some of the wisdom and disappointment that inform the witchs perspective but even in movies with badass princesses like braves merida the witch who gets consulted halfway through the story is a wizened old crone with a fondness for whittling outside the sympathetic librettos of stephen sondheim witches dont really even get much of a chance to compete for the title of hero  so ive loved seeing jolie don horns and fly around in harnesses in set photos from maleficent and im even more excited that shell be bringing her daughter to work with her the movies a reminder that we should consider sympathizing with the witches a little bit more frequently and viviennes appearance is a joke on all the peopleincluding jolies father jon voight who suggested jolie was an unfit mother witches dont just lock adorable blonde princesses in towers sometimes they give birth to them

schoolchildren before the royal pair headed back home to the uk  earlier they endured a nailbiting finish to the six nations rugby today when victory was snatched from wales after twenty minutes of overtime at the stade de france  kate looked a picture of elegance in a double breasted carolina herrera coat and flashed a beaming smile as she chatted to william when the players entered the pitch  as the dragons took the lead the future prince of wales finally looked back in his comfort zone after appearing awkward since he was filmed dancing like a dad in a club in verbier switzerland earlier

brave youve made amazing progress  the duchess added she would be keeping an eye out for jessicas work after learning she is retraining to work in fashion  jessica 25 said at first after the shooting

servicemen and women  william and kate were also shown an ornate book explaining how charles ii king of england wrote to louis xiv to ask him to share with him the plan about the creation of the hospital  it went on to inspire the foundation of the royal chelsea hospital  the duke of duchess of cambridge rekindled their shared love of art today when they visited pariss iconic musee dorsay  the couple first met when they both studied history of art at st andrews university in scotland although william later switched to geography and were keen to visit the museum which houses the largest collection of impressionist masterpieces in the world  in a tender moment william and kate even looked out onto the worlds most romantic city through the face of a giant clock  the couple toured the gallery on the second day of their twoday visit to paris  it remained open to the public throughout prompting gasps from tourists who crowded round to take pictures and videos of the royals on their phones  home to some of the greatest works of french and european art produced in the 19th and 20th centuries they had specifically asked to see one some of claude monets most famous paintings including one of his water lilies series painted in 1904  the french impressionist painted around 250 oil paintings of the flower garden at his home in giverny which were the main focus of his artistic output during the last 30 years of his life  the couple were also shown other monet masterpieces including his 1873 work coquelicots or wild poppies and his parasol paintings from 1886 titled essai de figure en plainair femme a lumbrelle they stopped to take a close look at london houses of parliament which was inspired by monets 1871 visit to london when he was struck by the effects of fog on the thames  william 34 asked director laurence des cars this is one of his most famous paintings isnt it  the 1904 masterpiece will go on loan to the tate britain later this year as part of an exhibition called the impressionists in london  the couple were also shown monets la rue montorgueil a paris a 1878 painting of a street which the queen visited during her 2004 tour of france  art enthusiast kate 35 who graduated with a 21 in 2005 asked lots of questions particularly about edouard manets olympia a nude painted in 1863 seemingly unfazed by the topless scene william pointed to a black cat in the picture and was told it was a tongue in cheek addition  another painting that caught their eye was gustave caillebottes raboteurs de parquet 1875 featuring halfnaked men sanding a floor by hand  a keen photographer kate has been patron of the national portrait gallery in london since 2012 and is also patron of a charity called the art room which encourages disadvantaged children to express themselves through artistic endeavours  kate once said i am a firm believer in the power of art to make a difference  william whose father and grandfather are both keen artists also studied history of art before switching to geography  it is thought that kates support in convincing him to switch subjects rather than quit university altogether is what first drew them together  situated on the left bank of the seine the musee dorsay is houses in the former gare dorsay a beauxarts railway station built between 1898 and 1900  it holds mainly french art dating from 1848 to 1914 including works by monet manet degas renoir cezanne gaugin and van gogh  having been used as a railway station for more than 80 years the decision was taken to close it down because its platforms were deemed too short for modern trains in 1970 permission was granted to demolish the building but after an eight year row it was finally placed on the list of historic monuments and former french president georges pompidou gave the go ahead for it to be turned into an art gallery it opened in 1986 with its original clocks remaining as a reminder of its transport heritage  a man was shot dead at paris orly airport this morning after taking a soldiers gun and fleeing into a shop taking aim at soldiers  less than two hours earlier three police officers were shot at in a suburb in northern paris by a gunman during a routine stopandsearch operation  police now believe the shooting in the northern paris suburb of stains which left one officer injured was carried out by the man who was later killed  after fleeing the scene the man stole a womans car at gunpoint

president obama is right  it appears the people running the trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes  after donald trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming its never been worse for them than it is right now one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly  wrong  as usual no one in the trump campaign learns their lesson and their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state  trumps campaign chair in the prominent mahoning county in ohio kathy miller has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people werent successful in the last 50 years its their own fault she also said there wasnt any racism until obama got elected and skirted problems under the table  if youre black and you havent been successful in the last 50 years its your own fault youve had every opportunity it was given to you youve had the same schools everybody else went to you had benefits to go to college that white kids didnt have you had all the advantages and didnt take advantage of it its not our fault certainly  miller then doubled down calling the black lives matter movement a stupid waste of time and said low voter turnout in the african american community as due to the way theyre raised  what does the way theyre raised supposed to mean maybe miller should take a look at the fact that the trump kids didnt vote and couldnt even vote for their dad before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids  miller resigned gave a halfass apology and distanced herself from the campaign of course trumps ohio state director bob paduchik stressed that millers comments were not reflective of the campaign and reduced her position to that of a simple volunteer to steer away any influence she once held  once again the trump campaign deflects blames and dodges responsibility oh and it once again shows that its being run by a bunch of entitled white racists  featured image a screengrab

11k shares facebook twitter  i cant believe this nonsense  youre going to be mad that i told you this  youre going to wonder where the toughness of america went and what happened to make people think being a pssy is the way to be  when i look at cops i envision people who are strong tough and hard working except for that one overweight cop that every station has you know the guy who actually eats the donuts forget him hell be on desk duty eventually im talking about real cops the cops i know are all in good shape work out and run towards danger they will save any person thats in harms way they dont care if the person is white black or even muslim a good cop saves everyone and thats what most cops are  good cops  and thats how its supposed to be  but then theres this idiot from the la police commission who wants cops to run away from armed suspects are you kidding me thats ridiculous cops are trained to eliminate threats not run away from the threat while the criminal either gets away or hacks someone with a meat cleaver  the daily caller  the los angeles police commission wants lapd police officers to run away when a suspect confronts them with a weapon warns the los angeles police protective league the labor union of the citys police officers  hypothetically speaking if i wanted to rob a bank tonight could i go there with a knife and the cops will run away from me  i dont have to stab anyone i just have to show cops that i have a deadly weapon and the cops will run to their cars and drive away is that how it works  that opens the pandora box for an unwarranted increase in crime based on the fact that lapd might be ordered to run away from violent perpetrators in the future  i guess the lapd wont be allowed to save lives anymore  very sad state of affairs if this really happens  i hope every lapd cop does the right thing and does not listen to this nonsense  cops are trained for battle and theyre not afraid to eliminate a violent threat  and we should let them eliminate a threat if it puts anyone in danger  training people to run away instead of eliminating will generate a nation of pssy cops and thats not who i want to protect me

2016 obamas team isnt laughing at trump anymore the presidents aides worry the republican represents more of america than a fringe  obamaworld laughed as it watched donald trumps hostile takeover of the gop after eight years of republican opposition inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president president barack obamas aides past and present thought republicans had gotten what they deservedand more all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago  theyre not laughing anymore  story continued below  going into monday nights debate obamas team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top hillary clinton aides maybe the country isnt what they thought maybe the resistance to obamacare and gay marriage and the progress theyre so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe theyve always dismissed maybe the presidents aides  current and former  now concede theyre going to have to live with the fact that trump could end up in the oval office in part due to a backlash against obama  im trying to think of a series to compare it to which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama said ben labolt a former white house aide and press secretary for obamas 2012 reelection campaign i feel like were maybe in the fifth season of breaking bad here were way beyond the laughs and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror  theres not a lot of mirth in the circles i run in about him said another former senior obama campaign staffer  privately obama has expressed mixed feelings according to people close to the president hes still nursing amusement at republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by trump but its mixed with frustration that there are so many americans he failed to reach people whove spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people whove benefited from his policieslike those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of obamacaresupport democrats  for obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the presidents climbing approval numbers trumps growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on hope even if clinton wins the republican has shown not only that america is divided between red and blue but that theres an america that obama never connected with at all and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as monopoly money  we are still the country that elected barack obama in 2008 and we are capable of that and more said jim papa a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the white house but were also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences  trumps already done things they never thought he could like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support and that was even before he riled up obama doubters again with his birther pirouette  and the result trumps doing better in the polls at this late stage than obamas team imagined with 43 days to go trump and clinton are essentially tied polls sitting within the margin of error even in battleground states  though only a few weeks ago current and former obama aides would joke about how the presidents great political legacy might be the republican party destroying itself in front of him now on the record they push back on the very suggestion that obamas legacy should be viewed in any frame that trump also occupies  i dont think he thinks its his legacy i dont think any of us think its his legacy said dan pfeiffer a former senior adviser to the president trumpism is a lot of things in this country president obama is the face of that for some republicans but the republican party got themselves into this mess  but they worry about what even a trump loss says about obamas america  i think he will lose badly in this election but i think the impact hes had on our political process is incredibly damaging and will be lasting said tommy vietor a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at trump ended a year ago hes made us look stupid i think he is stupid  for any efforts obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable as the president likes to say trump has shattered that vietor said he has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can it doesnt matter if its a low blow it doesnt matter if its not of substance thats a bad lesson for people to learn  according to earnest obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that hed had one to negotiate with on immigration reform trade infrastructure and other priorities the sense of lost opportunity eats at them as does the sense that its not going away despite their confidence in clintons chances  im not saying wed all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the national mall but i am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts said white house press secretary josh earnest whos been with the president since the first campaign  not everyones inside obamaworld is down some schadenfreude remains  hes still exposed and ripped apart factions of the gop enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates and will leave them with no infrastructure said a more upbeat former obama 2008 campaign spokesman hari sevugan  and democrats sense of the vacuous gop that trump represents continues to resonate particularly as they see the republican nominee attack an economy thats gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble  the eightyear legacy of the recovery from the great recession is clear evidence that the tea party movement said earnest is intellectually bankruptor about something other than the economy  but that doesnt take care of their grief about the state of american politics  id rather live in a world where the two parties really compete papa said than have a political edge on the republican party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized  authors

been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he will be advising mr trump on energy policy and russia  this piqued my interest i have been a russia wonk for most of my adult life i spent years living and reporting from moscow still go there regularly for reporting trips and am in touch with lots of friends there and yet despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in russia no one i spoke to had ever heard of carter page  whats this guys name says one former western energy ceo who spent years in russia and would have overlapped there with page  i had not heard of carter page before it came out in the media says another prominent western businessman who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades but i am getting a lot of emails from friends asking have you heard of this guy  strangely ive never heard of carter page until this trump connection bill browder responded to me in an email he was one of the biggest western players in the russian market until president vladimir putin turned on him and browder became his fierce critic its odd because ive heard of every other financier who was a player on moscow at the time  someone apparently has heard of him on friday yahoo news reported that page was being probed by us intelligence for purported backchannel ties to russian leaders the story resurfaced the name of a character whod all but vanished from the campaign and reawakened questions about who exactly trump was surrounding himself with  this has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began a realestate developer with almost no serious washington connections to tap for advice im going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people trump famously told a post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign we want topoftheline professionals as the primaries unfolded it became increasingly obvious that trump would need all the topoftheline help he could get when it came to foreign policy in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt trump confused the kurds with the iranian alquds force couldnt tell the difference between hezbollah and hamas and couldnt recognize the name of the leader of isis in his defense trump said that hugh was giving me name after name arab name arab name and there are few people anywhere anywhere that would have known those names the republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to antitrump manifestos and since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate who were the people who would line up to advise him instead what would they be like  enter carter page a 44yearold phd and business school graduate who claims an expertise in russia and energy yet who i quickly discovered was known by neither russia experts nor energy experts nor russian energy experts i can poll any number of people involved in energy in russia about carter page and theyll say carter who you mean jimmy carter says one veteran western investor in russian energy page also as i would be surprised to discover appears largely unknown to trumps own campaign  what i did find however is that while page might not be helping trump trump has been a significant help to page since being named by trump as an adviser page who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in russia and the former soviet union has finally begun to be noticed in the region he is being treated in russia as a person with potentially important ties in america hes an extremely wellinformed authoritative expert on russia says mikhail leontiev a prokremlin talking head and spokesman for rosneft russias state oil giant people really respect him in this industry hes a very serious guy and he has a good reputation according to the yahoo report us intelligence believes page had an audience with top russian officialsincluding rosneft head igor sechinduring a summer trip to moscow from what i could find about him its hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by trump  page has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the american press a march bloomberg profile touted his deep ties with executives at gazprom the stateowned russian gas giant whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade last month the post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in russia some of them unsavory the yahoo story also portrays page as a wellconnected highrolling businessman with extensive business interests in russia and an office around the corner from trump tower  page has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements including saying putin is a better leader than president barack obama to a june closeddoor meeting of foreign policy brahmins in washington in july in moscow he spoke at the new economic schools commencement ceremony a university that had hosted obama just seven years ago page used the speech to slam the hypocrisy of american foreign policy in front of a russian audience saying washington and other western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization inequality corruption and regime change he is now frequently quoted on russian television which hails him as a famous american economist and adviser to donald trump on questions of foreign policy  all of which reveals something deeply strange about trump when he shoots from the hip his remarks do more than just whip up twitter controversies they also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of insiders people who seem to be in trumps orbit but who may not haveand may never have hadany access to the gilded inner sanctum at all  but someone is paying attention as i started looking into page i began getting calls from two separate corporate investigators digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections page has to all kinds of shady russians one is working on behalf of various unnamed democratic donors the other wont say who turned him on to pages scent both claimed to me that the fbi was investigating page for allegedly meeting with igor sechin and sergei ivanov who was until recently putins chief of staffboth of whom are on the sanctions listwhen page was in moscow in july for that speech  so the question continued to linger who is carter page    i should tell you before we get any further that page wouldnt talk to me for this story i called his fund and left messages both on the general line and his personal voice mail i emailed him repeatedly i asked the trump campaign to put me in touch i emailed the bloomberg journalist who interviewed him who passed the request on i even called carter pages father in poughkeepsie new york who told me he would ask his son to talk to me but alas no dice  this was disappointing no one who worked in moscow when page was there seemed to know who he was and i just wanted to talk to someone who did at a certain point i just needed confirmation that he even existed  ok i thought try a different route maybe all these prominent western businessmen who worked in russia for decades didnt know page but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the russian economy he did after all have such an impressive résumé  pages biography on the website of his energy fund global energy capital hits all the right notes it was at first glance the résumé of an upandcoming player in the opaque but lucrative russian energy market he spent 7 years as an investment banker at merrill lynch in london moscow and new york where he most recently served as chief operating officer of the energy and power group his bio reads he was involved in over 25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector he spent 3 years in moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for gazprom rao ues and others  those were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s and pages tenure in merrill lynchs moscow office from 2004 to 2007 would have put him in the right place at the right time he says he was part of the carving up of rao ues a massive russian electric power holding company he told bloomberg that he advised gazprom when it bought a stake in the sakhalin ii oil and gas project those were huge huge things if he were deeply involved he would definitely count as a player and surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals  so i called ian craig the ceo of sakhalin energy from 2004 to 2009 who was doing the negotiations with gazprom and stayed on as ceo after the deal went through it wasnt really a deal to be clear sakhalin ii was a large project in the far east and gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake but craig said he didnt know anyone named carter page he was also surprised to hear about merrill lynchs purported involvement in the deal i dont think merrill lynch or anyone else was frontlining the negotiations because it was all done at the highest level because it was very political says craig  it closed at ceo level and eventually putin himself signed off on it  when i asked a prominent western businessman who has worked in the former soviet union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with sechin and other members of the russian elite about pages claim to bloomberg that he advised gazprom on sakhalin ii he said i rolled my eyes at that one he too said he hadnt heard of page until trumps announcement  fine ok maybe page exaggerated a bit on that one but what about the reorganization and privatization of rao ues the russian electricity giant maybe some of the russians he worked with remembered a carter page  turns out they did  his nickname was stranichkin from the russian word stranichka or little page says artem torchinsky who met page during the breakup of rao ues torchinsky who was part of the companys financial department worked alongside page who at the time worked in merrill lynchs moscow office it was 2007 and merrill lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of rao ues and torchinsky was resentful of page and the other merrill lynchers torchinsky and the inhouse team did all the work and page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation they were the fancy western window dressing it really irritated our team torchinsky told me over skype we worked around the clock and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and wed have to correct them these guys didnt know what they were talking about as for page he made no impression whatsoever whether he was there or not it made no difference torchinsky says when youre dealing with a pro you see it page unfortunately did not leave that impression  ok harsh but then i talked to pages former boss former russian central bank chairman sergei aleksashenko who ran the moscow office of merrill lynch for part of the time page worked there he wasnt great and he wasnt terrible aleksashenko says exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone without any special talents or accomplishments someone who was a gray spot what can you say about a person who in no way is exceptional he asked me  page was a vice president at merrill lynch in moscow which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world a big firm like merrill lynch might have thousands of vps in the moscow office there were five ranks and vp was right in the middle in effect it was just the oldest of the youngest three from the bottom says aleksashenko  when it came to finance aleksashenko says page was not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments when it came to energy page and his team were according to torchinsky mildly speaking not competent in the field of energy and says aleksashenko judging by the drivel he spews on russia you can tell he doesnt really understand the topic  trumps putative adviser on russia and energy and foreign policy in other words did not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or welleducated or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy says aleksashenko    for the past few years page has styled himself a foreign policy expert he has written columns in global policy journal a new peerreviewed journal run out of durham university they are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps in recent months renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the united states after the killing of michael brown and eric garner by police officers in missouri and new york respectively he wrote although commonly overlooked the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions he is the kind of thinker who writes that kanye wests new slaves and the artists creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of us foreign policy and world affairs but does it by opening with a citation from the oxford english dictionary slave pronunciation slāv roping in adam sandler william f buckley and dick cheney  his speech in moscows new economic school was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition tautologies and abuses of the word ironically for the last 15 years ive been researching teaching and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it he began the video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place he couldnt really speak russianhe had to have his questions translated for him into english except to quote haltingly brokenly vladimir putin we never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries unlike the usa which is troubling for two reasons that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing america abroad by citing putin and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in say syria or ukraine  page also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the council on foreign relations where he cut a strange figure like other westerners doing business in russia page took the view that putin was not the bloodstained and corrupt tyrant some in the west imagine him to be defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to russia but unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of putin people at the council recall that page was not particularly good at it he had a guiltyseeming style in making these arguments making it seem like he didnt really want to engage one person from the council says his columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows that blog post about the slaves thats just  strange says the council member  hes a nice guy but of the people that i know that have russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts he wouldnt be in the last decile but hed be in the secondtolast decile says one american executive with experience in russia and its energy sector youd have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like carter page i mean wow    i shouldve just dropped the carter page story but in the months since trump named him an adviser the campaigns russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue fancy bear who was probably a russian hacker broke into the democratic national committee emails seemingly handed them over to julian assange who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other trumps second campaign manager paul manafort flamed out in august because of his shady business dealings with the prokremlin side of ukraine and trump himself continues to say absurd things about russia and putin like publicly inviting the russian government to continue hacking american servers washington was in full hunt for red october mode and it was all i could do to stay on pages trail which began to look more and more like an infinity sign  i was not the only one seemingly everyone i talked to had also talked to the washington post and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of pages connections then there was page praising putin i found myself juggling two mutually contradictory page narratives was page like manafort followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the west this was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear was page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with china and turkmenistan who was a vehicle for the kremlin to influence the american election was he a man who during a threeday trip to moscow met with two of russias most powerful men and was now being investigated for it  but it was hard to see that man when i actually talked to people who knew him page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade securing a spot at merrill lynchs london and moscow offices today he claims he was cozy with gazprom executives his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion no one let him into gazprom aleksashenko says he didnt go shake gazprom chief alexey millers hand he made sure there were cars hotels and meetings for investors in london another of pages colleagues from merrill lynch confirmed that pages role was simply arranging meetings between gazprom and western investors something normally done by analysts the lowest rank on the totem pole people organize meetings with gazprom all the time the former colleague said he hosted these guys in new york city but they would have done this 10 times a year i used to do this it doesnt require all that much skill you just send out an email to 20 people saying gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 pm do you want to come the main thing is just getting those two gazprom guys to agree but because they agreed doesnt mean theyre close to him  but the meetings did provide him with something else gazprom didnt need money at the time says the former colleague they were the most profitable company at the time their net profit was something like 36 billion a year their problem was not getting investors but figuring out how to spend money in a nonefficient way if you read between the lines he was probably aware of that he would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is page became an investor in the company and has according to filings advised other companies hes worked for to invest in them  after merrill lynch page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it global energy capital but he tried to do this in 2008 and we know what happened to the markets in 2008 the fund is registered to his fathers address in poughkeepsie page listed himself as founder and managing partner even though the only other partner seemed to be sergei yatsenko who was once a midlevel executive at gazprom he also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy madison avenue addressthats the one around the corner from trump tower which was actually the address of a coworking space  thats carter page says an american businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in russia thats what hes been doing without any actual funding without any actual experience without any actual connections or core capabilities hes been trying to throw together these deals hes always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in russia is done i admire that it takes a lot of gumption  in the interest of due diligence i also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators that russias alfa bank paid for the trip as a favor to the kremlin that page met with sechin and ivanov in moscow that he is now being investigated by the fbi for those meetings because sechin and ivanov were both sanctioned for russias invasion of ukraine  i dont know this person said pyotr aven one of the two founders of alfa bank which is considered the western russian bank aven and his partner mikhail fridman have transferred much of their assets out of russia and have been quite critical of putin as for who paid for pages trip aven was no less irritated by the question i give them money i dont know how they spend it who they invite when they invite them i have no idea he said of the new economic school which hosted page and of which aven is the main benefactor exasperated by my questions he snapped dont bring these russianstyle conspiracy theories to me  you are engaged in onanism said leontiev the spokesman for rosneft and sechin when i asked him if page had met with sechin its bullshit just bullshit you need to understand who sechin is to even ask this question its hard to have a meeting with him at all its absurd  as for the fbi investigation well its unclear a state department official who works on russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that for one thing there is no prohibition meeting with a designated sanctioned individual moreover sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the fbi ofac runs them he added the story doesnt add up what does seem to have happened is that various us intelligence agencies were looking into pages time in moscow then briefed senate minority leader democrat harry reid who wrote a letter to fbi director james comey asking him to investigate among other things whether a trump advisor who has been highly critical of us and european economic sanctions on russia and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in russian energy conglomerate gazprom met with highranking sanctioned individuals while in moscow in july of 2016 well after trump became the presumptive republican nominee    i got my next surprise when i called stephen miller trumps senior adviser i caught him just as the trump plane was about to take off and asked him the tired old question who is carter page  who says miller and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign  he has no formal role in the campaign hope hicks texted responding to my question  now my interest was piqued there were whispers all over washington that despite hickss denial page was not only still part of the trump campaign but its conduit for russian influence was he  one way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with  one source suggested to me that richard burt former us ambassador to germany start treaty negotiator and longtime lobbyist for alfa bank was the nexus it was burt who helped draft trumps foreign policy speech in april and had been advising the trump campaign via senator jeff sessions on foreign policy but when i met burt at his office at the mclarty associates lobbying shop he looked at me and said he had never even met him the only person i talked to about carter page is this guy at the washington post burt told me and i told him id never met the guy let me put it this way if i have met him ive forgotten hes the former merrill lynch guy right  someone else told me that the page connection was rick dearborn sessions chief of staff who hired page because dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for trumps alexandria virginia policy shop and he happened to know page but dearborn wouldnt return my calls and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither dearborn nor burt but campaign cochair sam clovis who recruited page if he was part of that original group of people i can say with 70 percent confidence it was sam clovis this person told me  im not answering your questions clovis told me he refused to tell me if he was the one who found page but jason miller the campaigns other spokesperson says carter page isnt someone ive interacted with which confirmed what a policy staffer on the trump campaign told me carter is a red herring not a rasputin hes never met trump never briefed him he has zero influence none    was page the shadowy messenger between the kremlin and trump tower or was he the nebbishy notverysuccessful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what trump saidhes my adviserand what his associates saidwho maybe i wasnt doing this right and maybe everyone was lying to me but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that regardless of whatever game the russians were running page was firmly in the latter camp  i dont know about his russia fund other than its never really materialized says the prominent player in the energy space whom page has pitched on various energy projects every conversation ive had with carter has not been terribly serious theyve all been pieinthesky ideas there are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities he went on i couldnt name a project that i could connect carters name to any project that actually happened  i dont know how hes earned a living off this the energy player says but i think hes been trying to be an intermediary if you hang around russia long enough its sort of like a pinball machine something will hit you  strangely it was not a russian pinball that hit him it was trump according to the trump policy adviser this winter clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft at a time when established republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from trump a lot of people came to sam clovis in february march and said i want to be part of the team says the trump adviser and thats how it happened hes just a guy on a list trump looked at the list and said hes an adviser and now hes milking it for all its worth  now someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a very important person in washingtonor at least could plausibly market himself as one i was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign and even after that i had never heard of him one russia specialist in washington told me he saw page at a washington roundtable in june for indian prime minister narendra modi and what he saw was a strange kind of person one who was very differential to everyone there in a way that someone who is junior would use it to network but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listenand be impressed he was saying he was planning to go to moscow the russia specialist recalls he didnt say what he was going to do there but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip  according to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on pages trip to russia the meetings did happen and thats been established as a fact i think the investigation is more what happened in them but it remained unclear the staffer told me unprompted what this even meant its not just did he met with them or not but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on said the staffer is he acting as a conduit in ways that are against americas national security interests wittingly or un i should add its whats hard to parse about this is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a john le carré novel or are they being played by much smarter people in the kremlin  this seems to be vintage carter page a man whose story never quite adds up as much as he tries to make the numbers work but hes also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful more connected even more evil than he really isand to try to turn a profit off of that if page using his status as trump advisor for personal gain thats another matter time for page to join twitter michael mcfaul former us ambassador to russia tweeted after news of the investigation broke the russians may be feeling out the trump campaign via page but page must be loving every minute of it after all meeting russias energy czar is an impossible dream for a wouldbe investor struggling to make it in the world of russian energybut the dream entered the realm of the possible when trump said three words in march carter page phd now carter page phd has found a perfect candidate to latch on to like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious trump shark  for months now the american press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like page and manafort and through them to answer the questions of whether putin is trying to destroy america by their hands and is trump a kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot and is there even a difference  there doesnt seem to be one in the world of trump which in some ways resembles putins the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive and that is all that matters is putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of western democracy in a massive way or doing just enough to make us think he is and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them i want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of russia putin says of the rumors of russian meddling in the american electionas we in the media continue to squeegee them around rarely really getting closer to the truth and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think weve finally grasped it  julia ioffe is contributing writer

kanye west is launching his own makeup line called donda  rappercomedesigner kanye west has already conquered the music industry and taken on fashion with his yeezy line but now it seems that west is taking cues from his 19yearold sisterinlaw kylie jenner and branching out with a beauty brand  officially reentering the public eye following a muchneeded break from the spotlight tmz report that west has officially filed legal documents declaring his intention to launch a full collection of donda cosmetics  the line which is thought to involve everything from makeup and perfume to lotions will be an extension of the farreaching communications company he named after his late mother donda who passed away in 2007  not limited to beauty though west has previously tweeted an infographic explaining the categories of influence that donda as a brand might take on including amusement parks furnishings fitness medical research hovercrafts and steamboats  perhaps a makeup range isnt so farfetched after all  as someone that has shown littletono interest in beauty irl its hard to visualise what a line of kanye cosmetics would look like but while mainstream cosmetics for men is still in its infancy this does come after the likes of maybelline and loreal announced their first ever male spokesmodels  while little else is known at this stage following his attempts to be taken seriously as a fashion designer beauty seems a natural next step  the application to trademark the concept is currently processing and it looks like yeezydesigned cosmetics really are going to be a thing

early voting has begun in the battleground state of north carolina and after months of contentious litigation its clear why republicans wanted to squash it returns are showing democrats with an eight point advantage over republicans  data analysis from targetsmart who partnered with nbc news shows that of the 4000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast 42 percent come from registered democrats 34 percent from republicans 25 percent from unaffiliated and 1 percent from libertarians  contrast that to 2012 when mitt romney won north carolina by two percent in early voting that year in that state republicans held a five percent lead now democrats hold an eight percent lead in 2008 when president obama won by a slim margin of 033 percent democrats had an 11 point advantage in 2004 democrats had an 11 point advantage but kerry lost to bush by 13 percent  so while its not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins the last two elections in which early voting has increased tremendously shows that is the case  nate silvers fivethirtyeight currently gives clinton a 43 percent chance of winning north carolina and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall clintons chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week with one reason being a strong showing for democrats in early voting the new york times election model gives clinton a 48 percent chance of winning north carolina  again no wonder governor pat mccory who is currently losing his reelection bid and the gop legislature wanted to do away with it when democrats get a head start that usually means good news in november  democrats shouldnt get too comfortable although early voting points to a democraticleaning result republicans could very well and chances are great benefit from in person voting on november 8 president obama never overcame romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election almost all the polls for the month of september favored obama  with 45 days left until the election anything can happen so democrats need to continue to mobilize register and get out the vote for not just early ballots but for november 8  rachel maddow broke down the facts on her show  featured image via justin sullivangetty images
president barack obama has never had a great relationship with saudi arabia  now hes the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities  story continued below  obama has cast the saudis as socalled allies bemoaned the terroristinspiring version of islam they practice and even suggested the oilrich arab state learn to share the middle east with rival iran the saudis meanwhile consider obama naive sparring with him over the iran nuclear deal and questioning his handsoff approach to syrias bloody civil war  despite these differences obama has promised to veto a bill that congress passed unanimously allowing families of 911 victims to sue saudi arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks  that obama and riyadh find themselves on the same side against congress underscores the bizarre evolution of ussaudi ties over the past eight years an alliance once unquestioned in washington now faces an extraordinary level of criticism but the two countries still need each other enough that a breakup is simply not in the cards  this is clearly a relationship in transition said jon alterman an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies nobody really has a sense of what theyre trying to transition it to  just how tricky is the relationship two more examples obama is supporting the saudis in their fight against iranbacked rebels in yemen even though us officials worry the fight there is distracting from the more important battle against the islamic state and many of the same us lawmakers happy to make it easier to sue the saudis just this week greenlit a 115 billion arms sale to the country does no one sense the irony asked republican sen rand paul of kentucky one of a handful of lawmakers who tried to block the weapons deal in the senate  the back and forth in washington is schizophrenic behavior that has deeply frustrated leaders in the middle east for years said a former senior us official deeply familiar with the arab world  congress passed the lawsuit bill under intense pressure from families of victims and just ahead of the 15th anniversary of the sept 11 attacks the saudis through direct contacts as well as a powerful set of lobbyists have tried hard to stop it waging a major pr effort that included releasing a white paper detailing the kingdoms efforts to stop terrorists the saudis deny any government role in the attacks and note that the us has never found proof of it either the saudis also have warned they will sell off billions of dollars in us assets to protect themselves against lawsuits  administration officials downplay the idea that obama will veto the bill merely to protect saudi arabia normally us citizens arent allowed to sue foreign governments under the concept of sovereign immunity obamas concern officials say thus goes well beyond the saudis hes worried that the bill erodes the sovereign immunity principle and could lead other countries to allow the us to be sued over its actions abroad  to pass a piece of legislation that would open up our diplomats and our service members and even american businesses to potential lawsuits in courts all around the world is foolish white house spokesman josh earnest said in a recent press briefing  the perception in many quarters however is that obama is coming to the aid of a country with much to hide fifteen of the 19 hijackers on sept 11 2001 were saudi nationals and the recent declassification of roughly 30 pages from a 2002 congressional probe into the 911 attacks raised more questions about saudi government ties to islamist extremists  we are disappointed that the president is not standing with us said mindy kleinberg who lost her husband in the attacks and was meeting with lawmakers thursday to push for a veto override we have been waiting a very long time for justice and we feel that this bill will go a long way toward accountability  whatever his motivation obamas decision to veto the bill is unlikely to do much to ease saudi suspicions  the saudis wariness of obama has its roots in his comments in 2002 well before he ran for president referring to the monarchy in riyadh as a socalled ally it grew after obama sided against egyptian strongman hosni mubarak during the 2011 arab spring movements leading saudi royals to question whether america would have their backs in a domestic political crisis of their own  it deepened in 2013 after obama decided not to stage a military strike against syrian president bashar assad who is despised by the saudis even after assad apparently crossed obamas red line by using chemical weapons and it reached a new peak in 2015 after obama struck a nuclear deal with iran a shiite theocracy that sunnimajority saudi arabia views as a growing threat in the middle east  still obama cognizant of the need for the us to maintain alliances with stable countries in the middle east has otherwise tried hard to allay saudi concerns he cut short a trip to india to rush to see the newly crowned saudi king salman in january 2015 after the previous monarch died he also has pushed for new weapons and other security agreements with the saudis in part to assuage saudi concerns about the iran nuclear deal  but earlier this year in comments to the atlantic magazine that infuriated the saudis obama appeared to reverse decades of us policy that tilted heavily toward riyadh and against tehran  the competition between the saudis and the iranians  which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in syria and iraq and yemen  requires us to say to our friends as well as to the iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace obama said  prince turki alfaisal the former head of saudi intelligence wrote in an extraordinary open letter soon afterward that obama had thrown us a curve ball and criticizing the president for saying americas gulf allies were free riders wholly dependent on the us for their security  and in april weeks after the atlantic piece was published saudi arabia appeared to snub obama when he visited riyadh for a summit by sending a lowerlevel official to greet him at the airport and not broadcasting his arrival on state tv the readouts from those meetings in riyadh also suggested the president hadnt done much to assuage saudi concerns with the two sides saying theyd discussed and exchanged views more than agreeing on anything  the president also hosted saudi arabias deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman when he visited washington this summer on a trip aimed at improving the kingdoms image in washington obama made sure to praise the princes plan to transform the saudi economy dubbed vision 2030 he also tried to reassure the saudi royal that the us will back the saudis against interference by iran which remains an official enemy of the united states  but some constants in the ussaudi relationship have turned into variables meaning that even after obama leaves office in just a few months the alliance could prove rocky  the low price of oil for example is forcing the kingdom to rethink its economy the us also relies more now on its own energy reserves reducing americas addiction to saudi oil some observers also point to cultural changes in deeply conservative saudi arabia  women though still facing severe segregation make up a growing share of the workforce young people are more exposed than ever to the internet and the outside world and thousands of saudis educated in the us are now capitalizing on that experience in their country  by all accounts the us and saudi arabia still maintain a strong security relationship and us officials privately say the saudis are helpful partners in the fight against terrorist groups such as al qaeda which the saudi monarchy views as a threat to its own rule us officials also say the saudis have taken steps in recent years to silence the most radical of their islamist preachers and change their school curricula to be more tolerant  the close cooperation on countering violent extremists like the islamic state the continued saudi preference for american arms the important role that saudi arabia plays in international energy markets and the 70 billion dollars worth of annual trade between the two countries are enough to sustain this relationship for the foreseeable future said fahad nazer a former political analyst with the saudi embassy in washington who now does similar work for jtg inc  in many ways what obama thinks about the saudis matters less and less as his time in the oval office draws to an end but while the saudis will be happy to see him leave theres great uncertainty in riyadh about how the next president will deal with them  both democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump have voiced grave concerns about saudi arabias track record of producing islamic extremists clinton has said she supports the 911 lawsuit bill but while clinton would likely be a more predictable partner the saudis see trump  who has called for a ban on muslims entering the united states  as a wild card  for now however the saudis are nervously watching congress to see exactly how unhappy lawmakers are with them  already some members of congress are hinting that they are not comfortable with the 911 legislation after all and that they may consider voting to uphold obamas veto their hesitation comes as a growing number of foreign countries and blocs including the european union voice opposition to the bill the original bill passed on voice vote in both houses making a veto override especially sensitive because members will have to go on the record and with the presidential election looming the politics are even more fraught than normal  saudi arabia has never been an especially popular actor in washington  a powerful one but not popular the former senior us official said and now nobody in congress wants to stick their neck out for the saudis twoandahalf months before the presidential election  authors
stop right now the spice girls might be planning a reunion  there are certain things that people just shouldnt joke about a potential spice girls reunion with all five members is one of them  earlier this morning news broke that the most iconic girlband of all time may be reuniting in 2018 sending chills down the spines of every 90s girl power advocate up and down the country  according to the independent mel c has reportedly been working quietly with the bands former boss simon fuller over the past few months to bring victoria beckham mel b emma bunton and geri horner née halliwell back for the oneoff special with a compilation record expected to land next year  a source told the sun the five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer and finally they are all onboard for a 2018 reunion  as it stands they will be working together on a series of projects which will include an album and a tv special celebrating the spice girls  and getting victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion  but alas spice girls fans we need to stay rational about this  put away the platform trainers and ask yourself would victoria actually agree to this  let us present an analysis  although many a source is reporting that scary baby sporty ginger and posh are set to make a comeback next year we mustnt forget the numerous times that beckham has staunchly opposed a spice reunion  it was only earlier this year that exposh spice turned fashion mogul told us breakfast show the today show that there wont be a reunion because i think that when we performed at the olympics it was so great and that was us celebrating everything that wed achieved  she then went on to say i still talk to all the other girls were still very close but i think you need to know when its time to actually say that was great we achieved a lot and everybody moves on  a new album doesnt sound much like moving on does it  understandably victoria now has a family and a thriving business in the fashion industry to look after and in the past has cited these commitments as her reasoning for not wanting to reunite with her bandmates  all hope is not lost however as when asked about a potential spice girls reunion mel c was previously quoted on the nightly show saying i kind of feel like its not really doing the band justice to go out as a four piece whoevers missing it doesnt matter  so surely if there were to be some kind of reunion it must involve all five original members right  dare we believe the rumours that all five have been in secret talks over the summer and are on board should we really raise our hopes that high  whatever the case the spice girls will always viva forever in our hearts

new york  all politics is geopolitical in this years presidential race  and top democrats and republicans fear that will reshape americas relationships around the world no matter who wins  this week the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in new york as the united nations general assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim  story continued below  on monday hillary clinton will meet with ukrainian president petro poroshenkoa clear dig at the developing partnership between vladimir putin and donald trump shell also sit with japanese prime minister shinzo abe her campaign announced sunday night rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of china and north korea while reminding americans of donald trumps suggestion that america should pull its support from japan and south korea  clinton and trump both have scheduled meetings with egyptian president abdel fattah elsisian american ally though one with dictatorial tendencies the democratic nominee set hers up first aiming to project to voters that shes uptospeed on counterterrorism and other issues roiling the region trumps came second and was an attempt by sisi to ensure even dealings according to egypts state news agency nonetheless it might offer the republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on middle east issues that goes beyond simply banning muslim immigrants from america  keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for mitt romney four years ago and obamas summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200000person rally in berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forwardlooking europeans and support the upstart young senator  but none of this compares to the degree to which this years race is defined by global affairs  the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of american foreign policy  clinton is already planning if elected to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that trump and the number of votes he gets in november isnt a sign that they need to be worried about america turning away from them  shes very concerned said a clinton aide theres no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what hes said it has an effect on foreign policy  certainly presidential politics simply no longer stops at the waters edge and this year it has lapped aggressively perhaps dangerously over americas borders  it will have lasting impact said sen ben cardin dmd the ranking member on the foreign relations committee  it has been changed agreed rep peter king rny a former chairman of the homeland security committee and a trump supporter it gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it  there has been a long list of international neverbefores in 2016 including trumps decision to accept an invitation from mexicos president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare americas sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries and thats hardly all  there was the alleged russianled hacking of democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through wikileaks trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of crimea from the gop party platform italian prime minister matteo renzi saying hes personally rooting for clinton vice president joe biden saying trump doesnt understand nato on a trip to latvia last month president barack obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election  and just friday london mayor sadiq khan speaking in chicago accused trump of playing into the hands of isil  officials openly wonder what clintons approach as president would be now to mexican president enrique peña nieto or how quickly and forcefully nato would restructure if trump wins what if china or russia or north korea moves to test the new president right after inauguration day what if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts  while many in washingtons diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how clinton as opposed to trump would want to respond doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do  her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on trump the aide acknowledged but theyre also about thinking through what being on the job on jan 20 might entail  take poroshenko who is rebuking putin just by being in office its impossible not to read politics into it somewhat but because of the way trumps been talking over the course of the campaign secretary clinton thinks its important from a policy standpoint the aide said  if trump wins hell have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that us voters had elected him and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order  they will certainly want to see where were coming from king said he will have to clarify and make it clear where hes coming from  if clinton wins shell have a cleanup that cardin and others compare to the repair mission obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on george w bush  cardin whos firmly behind clinton ran through a litany sitting in harare earlier in the year watching zimbabwean president robert mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to trumps success the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter  can you imagine if trump were president and were trying to get a coalition against isil and we need to get the support of moderate sunni states and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position can you imagine what donald trumps comments about muslims coming to america would have on a leader of a moderate muslim state cardin said its that type of problems that have now been caused  this has all made for tricky travels for obama as hes spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified being abroad doesnt stop people from asking for his take on trump and the race whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far  its not a mystery to people overseas that democrats and republicans in the united states have their differences said a senior administration official so thats why leaders traveling overseas dont make as much of an effort to conceal it  from the beginning of his presidency obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order from shifting more of the burden in the middle east to arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on putin and brought the iranians to the nuclear negotiating table to reopening cuba  hell make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the un general assembly tuesday morning  but the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is trump didnt run his mexico trip by the white house clinton didnt run her meetings this week by the white house either  were having a serious debate said ivo daalder now the president of the chicago council on global affairs and obamas first us permanent representative to nato were going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate  authors

on the night of september 26 as the house lights dim in the mack complex at hofstra university and the tv cameras go live millions of americans will be riveted to the scene will donald trump seem well prepared will hillary clintons commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president  experience suggests its hard to make a positive breakthroughespecially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked but what is possible is a serious unforced error  story continued below  over the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised one of their great legacies has been the sudden public gaffea mistake live on tv that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate  despite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day the truth is that these are televised performances what the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies every breath they take every expression they make and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how americans evaluate their performances and although debates dont usually transform how most voters think of the candidates they do confirm voters impressionswhich matters on election day  for both candidates this will be a particularly big challenge donald trump is a largerthanlife presence who likes to intimidate cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of boundswhich could lead to an unforced error by hillary clinton hillary clinton who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under trumps skin instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling if either of these happens it will join the long line of memorable campaignchanging moments that candidates fumbled into  1 1960 nixon sweats while debating jfk  famously the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs after eight years as vice president richard nixon was running to inherit the white house from the enormously popular dwight eisenhower his challenger was john f kennedy the charismatic young massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matineeidol looks captivated much of the nation  on september 26 at the candidates first debate nixon proved to be in strong command of policy but he looked terrible famously prior to the debate he declined to have any makeup applied to his face but that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection as a result he looked peaked  video the biggest unforced errors in debate history from richard nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to george hw bush checking his watch before an audience questionhere are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in us history  during their televised rumble nixon could be seen sweating and on camera wiping his brow with a handkerchief his pale color and five oclock shadow didnt help all of which undercut his performance against kennedy who was a vision of youthful vigor  2 1976 ford and carter freeze in a moment of crisis  a more dramatic moment occurred on september 23 1976 when the sound system malfunctioned in philadelphias walnut street theater forcing a 27minute delay during the debate during which president gerald ford and thengovernor jimmy carter awkwardly stood still on stage the broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems  neither candidate wanted to move fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that saturday night live could imagine moderators robert mcneil and jim lehrer kept talking as the candidates stood helplessly like two hollywood standins wrote jules witcover in the washington post  years later ford admitted that i suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system but i think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we werent physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this in the end both men were diminished they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights  3 1980 carters grimfaced critiques seem too selfserious  in politics brevity can be a virtue during his only debate with ronald reagan in the fall of 1980 jimmy carter didnt get that lesson  in front of a recordbreaking 806 million viewers carter was hoping to paint ronald reagan as a creature of the far rightsomeone like barry goldwater the gop nominee whom lyndon johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier as reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate relatable republican carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how reagan had opposed medicare in 1964  while carter looked grim on the attack reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase there you go again he said with a laugh the line undercut carters entire argument making reagan look like the bigger man  4 1984 mondale lets reagans oneliner negate a serious weakness  during 1984s first debate reagan then 73 aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions he stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement his opponent former vice president walter mondale was crisp and sharp in contrast reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers lou cannon wrote that reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser stu spencer that he had flopped the wall street journals headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist new question in race is oldest president now showing his age  fortunately for reagan he came back with a vengeance in a later debate when baltimore sun journalist henry trewitt asked reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency reagan had a quip for the ages i will not make age an issue in this campaign i will not exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience  the audience erupted in laughter including mondale which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge  5 1988 dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question  perhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by cnn anchor bernard shaw to massachusetts gov michael dukakis at the second debate of 1988  dukakis was widely seen as a technocrat a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters the night before the debate at 2 am shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate and so he began the debate with it governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer  reporters were shocked but dukakis seemed unperturbed in a clinical and dispassionate manner dukakis simply said no i dont bernard and i think you know that ive opposed the death penalty during all of my life i dont see any evidence that its a deterrent and i think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime  it was as though dukakis was talking about a stranger answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have it was a question about dukakiss values and emotions his campaign director susan estrich later recalled when he answered by talking policy i knew we lost the election  6 1992 bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question  during the 1992 campaign few moments were more devastating to george hw bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a townhall debate with bill clinton and ross perot  right before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average americans bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left only 10 more minutes of this crap bush would later say he was thinking at the time  checking the time wouldve been unflattering in a normal debate setup but coming as it didduring a debate in which ordinary americans posed questions to the presidential candidatesit seemed like bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say for a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him  7 2000 gore sighs eyerolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with bush  entering the debates in 2000 vice president al gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in george w bush gore had been in highprofile debates before and his team was confident that the debates would show american voters that bush a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president  during the first debate gores overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with bush backfired big time at several points microphones caught gore loudly sighing in response to bushs answers which played into republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending and as bush criticized the democrats plans for their fuzzy math gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration  at the third debate a townhallstyle affair one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened gore walked right up to bush as he was speaking as if to physically intimidate him looking up with an annoyed glance bush seized the moment nodding his head with a smirk and continuing on with his statement making gores action look odd as the audience laughed  donna brazile who ran gores campaign believed that gore won the debates on policy but on mannerisms and the takeaway he ended up losing  many of us remember the splitscreen and al gore was sitting there rolling his eyes perhaps looking at george bush and basically he started to sigh  8 2004 bush cannot contain his irritation at kerry  after the first debate of the general election in 2000 president bush came under criticism when he couldnt contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent senator john kerry made about bushs record  though bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against vice president al gore the critics werent so kind to bush in 2004 when cameras caught him scowling clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern as he listened to kerry speak the democratic national committee didnt wait long to pounce on the president in their online video faces of frustration viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with

doors to the house are open as if posing some riddle from a fairy talewhich one to enter inside the vibe is airy and calm all open windows and crossbreezes creamywhite unlit candles soft creamywhite furnishings finally she emerges from the other side of the house and glides across the room in a creamywhite floorlength caftan her hair is down her feet bare only a touch of makeup her skin luminous she smiles widelya beneficent ethereal wood nymph but as soon as she starts speaking you realize that your preconceived notions about jolie arent quite right shes not a celestial goddess shes not the highandmighty dogooder shes not the intense control freakor at least not obviously so she comes across rather as normalperson friendly and practical even chitchatty she explains the deal with the big empty mansion she moved into this space just four days ago with her six kids it wasnt for the prestigious history or the architecture she needed a good place fast somewhere secluded with a lot of rooms this one which was listed for around 25 million has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms following her september 2016 filing for divorce from brad pitt she and her children spent nine months in a rental basically living out of suitcases and so she hasnt really unpacked barely knows her way around the place has never had a real visitor and isnt sure where the best spot is to sit and talk with that in question she roams from room to roomthe fabulous kitchen worthy of a nancy meyers movie charming gray library with a library ladder her favorite room in the house the generous landing at the foot of a sweeping staircase anchored by a round table with a bouquet of white flowers she finally settles on the living room which a setdecorator friend furnished on the fly with two creamywhite sofas and some big throw pillows she looks at them curiously i didnt even know i needed throw pillows  decorating house stuff that was always brads thing on cue as if taunting her jolies large rottweiler dusty soaking from a trip to the pool jumps onto the sofa soiling it she sighs amused half tries to wipe it off with her bare hand then gives up and sits somewhere else photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl life in her household is apparently like thismessy relaxed normal the kids are polite but not phony polite zahara 12 whom jolie describes as the rock of the family comes downstairs zaz jolie cries midsentence they discuss the whereabouts of everyone else zahara hugs the wet dog jolie laughs and tells her daughter about the swim dusty just took we move to the kitchen where jolie fixes herself a cup of tea vivienne 9 comes in with a friend having just been at a sleepover shes wearing a jean backpack covered with pins jolie envelops her in her arms i ask the girl if shes called viv or vivienne either one she says with a smile she dumps her stuff on the counter and goes out to play with her friend jolie picks up a small piece of a blanket shredded to death and explains laughing she has 32 blankets she is very into her blanket and she gets very mad if you wash her blanket she actually said to me the other day mom i can taste my blanket that honey is a sign that it really really needs to be washed  jolie tidies up viviennes things and promptly spills her entire mug of tea all over the counter we step outside and theres shiloh 11 and knox 9 hanging out shiloh who likes to dress like a boy is wearing a camouflage jacket long shorts and heavy black sneakers despite the blazing heat knox immediately wants to know when jolies going to put up the waterslide how about a hello mom she says with a hug sounding like just about every other loving exasperated mother in america so far theres only one piece of personal artwork upa blackandwhite photograph on the mantelpiece of the six children smiling and holding their various petsdogs reptiles and rodents  jolie and pitt whod been together for 12 years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in hollywood split last september she filed for divorce suddenly for the health of the family according to her lawyer and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children three of whom are adopted maddox 15 pax 13 and zahara three of whom are biological shiloh vivienne and knox things had been rocky for some time but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between pitt and maddox when they touched down jolie went home with the kids effectively kicking him out this was no conscious uncoupling an anonymous phone call was made to authorities the fbi and the los angeles county department of children and family services began investigating pitt for child abuse he was soon cleared and later said in an interview with gq style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem there were rumors he was having an affair with marion cotillard denied by both pitt and cotillard jolie got the early jump prwise but pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in gq style the two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce as for jolie a life already bursting at the seamswith acting directing humanitarian work parenting six kids and guestlecturing on womens rights at the london school of economicsjust got exponentially bigger and more complicated because shes now doing it alone theres the chaos surrounding the practical daytodayplaydates doctors appointments packing and unpacking and organizing mealtimes and theres the deeper emotional chaos its just been the hardest time and were just kind of coming up for air this house is a big jump forward for us and were all trying to do our best to heal our family as it happens the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet jolie has directed a moving largescale adaptation of first they killed my father loung ungs 2000 memoir of the khmer rouge genocide in which ungs parents and two of her siblings perished along with an estimated two million other cambodians a quarter of the countrys population shot entirely in cambodia and in the khmer language the film a netflix original is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war and according to the reports of several cambodians whove seen it its one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the countrys history a history thats still difficult for cambodians to discuss but if cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift then its surely a thankyou gift for jolie cambodia is where she started her family and its where she made a cathartic personal transformation becoming the woman she is today  recall if you can the angelina of the late 90s the era of angie peak crazy specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wildchild restless self jolie won three golden globes for her roles in television movies and a best supportingactress oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in girl interrupted she talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and selfcutting and her love of knives she and new husband billy bob thornton wore each others dried blood in pendants around their necks and publicly bragged about their wild sex at the 2000 oscar ceremony she talked provocatively about being so in love    right now with her brother james and kissed him with unsettling intimacy to be sure jolie had legitimate pain in her early lifeher father actor jon voight had been unfaithful to her mother marcheline bertrand and the two split up early on but it was first world pain being hollywoods newest it girl landed jolie the title role in lara croft tomb raider based on a popular video game as it happened the movie an example of hollywoods most vacuous commercial shootemup instincts was filmed on location in cambodia there jolie whod grown up in privileged bubbles in los angeles and new york witnessed what real suffering looked like poverty the loss of limbs from land mines a generation of relatives wiped out in this world there was no room for freefloating malaise or selfindulgent antics and in spite of their profound trials i found a people who were so kind and warm and open and yes very complex recalls jolie you drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things but not often expressing happiness you go there and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl she suddenly became curious about the worldstarting with the country she was in one day in siem reap cambodia she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for 2 ungs memoir it was among the factors that inspired jolie to find a greater purpose in 2001 equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could she contacted the united nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the high commissioner for refugees on one of her first un missions in 2002 she returned to cambodia to meet up with ngo workers who were dealing with landmine issues among them was ung the author of that transformative book who had moved to america since the war but had spent her adult years working on cambodias troubles she had never seen an angelina jolie movie but jolie certainly didnt seem like anyones vision of a movie star she was just a really cool human being recalls ung and she didnt mind getting dirty on her relationship with brad pitt we care for each other and care about our family and we are both working towards the same goal she and jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a landminefilled part of cambodia where ung hadnt been since the war thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a moviebut it wasnt they met up with a bunch of deminers took off on mopeds with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies when a monsoon started soaked they went to bed in hammocks before going to sleep jolie realized she already trusted ung enough to ask her about something personal something big shed been thinking aboutadopting a cambodian orphan i asked her as a cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me an outsider to do that or if that would be a nice thing recalls jolie ung was wholeheartedly supportive angie was maternal to everybody around her not just children but adults included i wanted her to adopt me says ung i was orphaned when i was eight years old and so i think when youve gone through experiences like that theres always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life jolie says that ungs enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor had she responded differently explains jolie it might have changed my decision it might have made it very hard for me ung has been in jolies life ever since and is now one of her few close friends jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion a couple of months later she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of battambang having promised herself that shed go only to one that she wasnt going to shop around but jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms meeting the children i didnt feel a connection with any of them she recalls photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl they then said theres one more baby  baby maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling she looked at him he looked at her i cried and cried she recalls  and thus began a 15year project in which jolie rebranded herself expanding her world her family her career and her image she bought a house in cambodia and became a citizen in 2003 she started what became the maddox joliepitt foundation focusing on cambodias environmental conservation health education and infrastructure she intensified her un work going on dozens of factfinding missions to such global hot spots as sierra leone afghanistan iraq bosnia and haiti shes now been on more than 60 missions she split from thornton who didnt understand her newfound passion she adopted her second child zahara from ethiopia in 2004 she met pitt on the set of mr  mrs smith when he was still married to jennifer aniston for jolie dating pitthollywoods gorgeous laidback golden boycatapulted her to another level of fame though she has maintained that they didnt become romantically involved until he and aniston had split the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of w which did a 32page spread of them playing house with a pretend brood of five aniston was devastated for pitt dating jolie meant doing it her way at least at the outset it marked the beginning of his own philanthropic lifein africa haiti and new orleansand he formally adopted maddox and zahara he persuaded jolie to have biological children she gave birth to shiloh in 2006 in namibia then the twins vivienne and knox in 2008 in between they adopted pax then three from vietnam they bought more homesin france spain new york and new orleans while pitt as a producer and actor churned out one prestige movie after another moonlight the tree of life moneyball 12 years a slave jolie took a new chance with directingwith in the land of blood and honey about bosnia a project inspired by some of the un work shed done there together they appeared unstoppable the most creatively alive citizens on the planet nothing seemed beyond their abilities they traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight making art doing good and setting up home wherever they happened to be they tied the knot in 2014 mainly because the kids wanted them to they had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went but jolies idea of an education meant immersion in the real world to bring an understanding of ones small part in the bigger picture for a time it all worked beautifully photographs by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl  it was 2012 and jolie had recently finished in the land of blood and honey she wanted her next project to be just as meaningful and ungs story had at this point been with her for a decade by the time they had a completed draft the chance for jolie to direct unbroken based on the bestselling book by laura hillenbrand had come along and they put the script aside after that maddox who knew auntie loungs story brought it up he was the one who said its time to do it  says jolie she knew that maddox would be deeply involved in the production that hed be standing there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other so he had to be ready jolie and ung dived back in credited on the film as an executive producer maddox read draft after draft giving comments jolie took it to netflix where chief creative officer ted sarandos signed on without hesitation in the room she created a visual experience of what this film could be recalls sarandos the film is in many ways about the death of beauty about the way the khmer rouge had killed all things beautiful color itself which becomes part of the joy of life    thats what hooked me more than anything despite jolies cambodian ties she felt she needed a cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project so she reached out to rithy panh one of the most famous filmmakers in cambodia who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the khmer rouge in several documentaries including the missing picture which was nominated for the bestforeignlanguagefilm academy award in 2014 she and panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if cambodia wanted it to benot a foregone conclusion given that cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history the killing fields roland joffés 1984 film about the khmer rouge had to be filmed in thailand and elsewhere the war tribunals which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing have helped open up the topic still jolie was trepidatious and approached the countrys culture ministers gingerly explaining that they were telling not just ungs story but also the story of a people jolies cambodian track record made the difference says ung in a country like cambodia respect is very much elevatedrespect for each other respect for the culture respect for the history respect for the elders angie walks in cambodia with this respect cambodia went all inclosing off battambang for days giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the khmer rouge army its not a poetic thing to saythis film was made by the country says jolie between cast and crew some 3500 cambodians participated  to cast the children in the film jolie looked at orphanages circuses and slum schools specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship in order to find their lead to play young loung ung the casting directors set up a game rather disturbing in its realism they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for and then to snatch it away the director would pretend to catch the child and the child would have to come up with a lie srey moch the girl ultimately chosen for the part was the only child that stared at the money for a very very long time jolie says when she was forced to give it back she became overwhelmed with emotion all these different things came flooding back jolie then tears up when she was asked later what the money was for she said her grandfather had died and they didnt have enough money for a nice funeral that authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved says jolie making for a film set like nothing shed ever seen there wasnt a person who was working on the movie who didnt have a personal connection they werent coming to do a job they were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family and it was out of respect for them that they were going to recreate it    it completed something for them some had flashbacks and nightmares for this reason a therapist was on set every day and then there were the odd bystanders who hadnt been aware that a movie was being made and were traumatized in one scene recalls jolie when the khmer rouge came over the bridge we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed they were horrified to see them come back given the size and complexity of the production a different hollywood director might have consciously or not muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish according to ung and panh jolie knows cambodia so well shes internalized the countrys character traits at lunch she waited in line like everyone else recalls panh and she never raised her voice here we dont shout we talk he says in cambodia yelling is not just disrespectfulits also considered a sign of weakness photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl many eyes were on maddox who is as famous in cambodia as jolie it was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked says jolie who wasnt sure how hed ultimately react to the experience would he connect would he want to flee jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard maddox say can i go sleep in my house with my friends referring to their house in the jungle which she had bought back in 2002 i hadnt heard him refer to it that way you cant push it you cant say isnt this great you just have to kind of keep bringing them there putting it in front of them    and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort she considers the endeavor to connect maddox to his homelandas she does zahara to ethiopia and pax to vietnama family effort not a solo one with that in mind while pitt was in the middle east working on war machine the other five kids also went to cambodia and played a role official or not in their mothers movie pax did still photography the other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors in february the film premiered for an audience of 1000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of angkor wat according to numerous reports it was a screening filled with tears of recognition remembrance and catharsis what moved jolie perhaps more than anything was that the cambodian people had a big movie premiere they saw a movie for which they made the sets it was their actors doing a great job their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors  alas while she was making film history for a country her relationship with pitt was suffering by the time first they killed my father was in postproduction in the summer of 2016 things got bad says jolie i didnt want to use that word    things became difficult  there has been hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on pitt and that he was craving a more stable normal life for the whole family when i bring this question up to her its the one moment when jolie becomes a bit defensive our lifestyle was not in any way a negative she says quickly adamantly that was not the problem that is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children    theyre six very strongminded thoughtful worldly individuals im very proud of them jolie has indicated that for the sake of the kids she doesnt want to talk about the breakup and yet it seems she wants to get her point across which calls for a careful choice of words something of a highwire act theyve been very brave they were very brave in times they needed to be other statements are similarly cryptic were all just healing from the events that led to the filing    theyre not healing from divorce theyre healing from some    from life from things in life i mention pitts mea culpa in gq style did it surprise her no she replies looking unmoved i refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved and ask if thats true theres a long pause she looks down formulates an answer we care for each other and care about our family and we are both working towards the same goal theres anger and pain right there beneath the surface but shes trying to keep the emotions at bay i was very worried about my mother growing upa lot i do not want my children to be worried about me i think its very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them they need to know that everythings going to be all right even when youre not sure it is photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer the disease took her mothers life when she was just 56 as well as those of other family members in a 2013 new york times oped column jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the brca1 gene two years later while working in the editing room on by the sea she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer ten minutes later the rooms spinning and you just think how     she kept the news from the kids did further tests and waited a few agonizing days when she finally learned she didnt have cancer i dropped to my knees she made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out i went into the actual surgery happy as they come i was skipping because at that point it was just preventative she instantly went into menopause last year in addition to hypertension jolie developed bells palsy a result of damage to facial nerves causing one side of her face to droop sometimes women in families put themselves last she says until it manifests itself in their own health jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition lately her skin has become drier she reports and she has extra gray hairs she quips i cant tell if its menopause or if its just been the year ive had the idea that she could still be anyones idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her but she says i actually feel more of a woman because i feel like im being smart about my choices and im putting my family first and im in charge of my life and my health i think thats what makes a woman complete photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by jessica diehl  tomorrow jolie and the kids are headed to africa theyre visiting namibia where shiloh was born and kenya where jolie will be checking in with a project connected to the preventing sexual violence initiative an organization she cofounded with british former foreign secretary william hague specifically members of the british military and peacekeepers will be receiving training in how to protect women from sexual violence in crisis zones its not the obvious dream itinerary for a kid and jolie admits that shes started to get a little pushback with the older ones im conscious that the boys are teenage boys and maybe theyd rather be watching tv with their friends and theyve been to africa and they may not be as excited as the little ones but they dont really challenge me they just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say what are we going to do there  she assured them that shed planned fun activities for them like sandboarding in any case they know that its important and they know that mom thinks that its going to be important when theyre older she knows it sounds a little strange but jolie cant help who she is i never woke up and thought i really want to live a bold life i just cant do the other its the same as i cant make a casserole i cannot sit still for all her earlier talk about being interested in keeping house now as the conversation turns to africa shes champing at the bit desperate to flee ive been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories and im getting better at all three but now i need to get my boots on and go hang take a trip she believes that her personal will is infectious the other day she made some joke to knox along the lines of pretend to be normal he said who wants to be normal were not normal lets never be normal thank youyes were not normal lets embrace being not normal photograph by mert alas and marcus piggott styled by

72k shares share this story  the first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates  instead the viewing audience was treated to a onesided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media  there is no love lost between the two businessmen and cuban even said of trump there was no bigger jagoff in the world  the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least 600 million the shameless trump who became more unhinged as the night progressed freely gave away one of his biggest secrets  that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years  clinton speculated about this and like a predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clintons hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said that makes me smart trumps cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate  an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement and denied he had ever said it this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat when asked  it sounds like you admitted you havent paid federal taxes and that was smart is that what you meant to say trump replied no i didnt say that at all  trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed after the debate cuban said  i get audited every year my taxes are  it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that i have to spend and i tell my tax lawyers and everybody you know take advantage of  do what the law recommends but im not against paying taxes and ill give you a perfect example when the dallas mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening i had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything i didnt do it a couple years ago we had some issues in dallas i just wrote a check to the general treasury this year we had after the shootings in orlando i had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas i just wrote a million dollar check to the city of dallas to support a bunch of different programs im im the luckiest guy in the world theres nobody whos been as blessed as me and my family so far knock on wood is healthy and at some point you have to realize you have to give back and you have to realize that this is a country thats been great to us and you cant just take take take take take take  mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart debatenight pictwittercomupnunatukv  stefan becket becket september 27 2016  the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him while admitting he owes his success to society trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible while offering to pay back nothing did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes no did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes no  trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent because if they did they would certainly not support him trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed in trumps world there is a twotiered system one for him and one for everyone else  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

kim kardashian opens up to about life after the paris robbery  this morning kim kardashian west is a few minutes late to breakfast because she cant get this gelmask thing off her face shes staying in a room in the upper reaches of the baccarat hotel in midtown manhattan a room with a giant bed in it in which she slept butt to butt with her fouryearold daughter north and in that room she applied a mask  of the cosmetic variety not the halloween variety  only to discover she couldnt really get it off where did she get this gold gelmask thing thats supposed to make your skin healthier man when youre kim kardashian west you dont know where everything comes from people just give you stuff the vaults and doors and expressdelivery accounts of the world open and a free flow of stuff just washes over you kim tries to enjoy it because thats the enlightened thing to do but right now shes upstairs in her room trying to separate her face from the free gelmask thing  it is 8 am i wait for her in the sumptuous lobby baccarat for those who do not shop for 10000 vases is a french company that makes crystal and being inside the baccarat hotel is like being inside a fine crystal lamp where an urbane french genie who wears louis vuitton suits lives heres the kind of place it is 46 from le menu du petit déjeuner at the petit salon in the hotel gets you two eggs potatoes bacon juice andcoffee there is an actual crown on display on a shelf full of curios and crystals unless its the worlds most bejeweled serving dome  but kim k does not make me wait too long seven minutes after 8 she arrives she looks somehow naked her face anyway it is scrubbed clean i guess from the mask removal there is a stunning absence of makeup except for some lip balm that she tells me she got in iceland which is ironic given that the 36yearold recently launched her own makeup line its called kkw beauty  predictably she has utterly crushed the stuffforyourface market the way she has crushed all other markets i think part of the reason her facial nudity is so striking is that being simple and unadorned isnt really her role her role is more queen of america  married to the king ofhiphop fashion intellectual provocation and possible publicinsanity performance art queen of instagram queen of a certain type of television queen of relevance the queen of calabasas california which if you dont know is the mount olympus of our time will smith lives there and justin bieber and drake and the rock and the osbournes and if you think about whos the queen of those people wouldnt you say kim kardashian west  i know youre probably wondering what she was wearing youre probably saying to yourself what did she eat for breakfast im not going to make you wait for it she wears this cool rocky balboa retro gray cotton hoodie with the 1980 american olympic team logo on it and gray sweatpants and she orders scrambled eggs with tomatoes mushrooms and onions mixed in an english muffin and some english breakfast tea with loads of honey did she eat everything dont be afraid to wonder if you dont care whether kim kardashian west ate her english muffin you need to go back to kim kardashian west school so you can appreciate the wonderful granular gossipyness thats part of whats so enjoyable about knowing everything about kim k before you come back here with your toogoodtowanttoknowifsheeatsherenglishmuffinness  im like the most fit ive ever been she says how do you get in shape if youre kim k the same way you do everything instagram you go and you find this bodybuilder on instagram and you contact her you find someone who as kim k tells it had an amazing transformation after she had a baby and kim k happened to be in the market for a really amazing transformation after giving birth now kims working out an hour and a half a day  kim kardashian west  i dont want to scandalize you  has had her picture taken nearly naked before for playboy  and completely nude for paper gq and w magazines and that doesnt even include the original document of her fame the storied ray j sex tape my publicist would say to me youre not getting naked i have to be there  she says i suggest that if your publicist keeps warning you not to get naked she must know youre always in danger of getting naked  is there an age limit for the naked photo shoot  yes she says im like im going to tone it down but then im like wait i cant be doing it in 10 years so  i might as well i dont know what the age cutoff is  we know everything about kim kardashian west she has shown us everything talked about everything many times in different languages kim has talked about basketball and baby poop and having no idea where pickles come from and the texture of cardboard and kanye and caitlyn jenner  and her sisters boyfriends drug problems recently on her show we even watched her share the story of how difficult her pregnancy and birthing process was and how shes looking at some alternatives to carrying her next kid herself have you ever considered besides the solipsism the bravery in that you know the unflinching way she takes off her top in front of a camera or wears a 75 billion dress thats how unflinchingly she talks about the fragility of her own human body its feminist its a psa here in this glassenclosed beveled luxury maze while wealthy french businessmen finish eating their 46 toast i ask if shes thought about a third child and she retains this unblinking steadystate feline eye contact and a sense of selfassurance that could freeze water while she says i would like to but ive had lots and lots of complications i had preeclampsia and then i also had something called placenta accreta weve explored surrogacy were thinking about it  i get the vibe from her that just as she has the crushing instincts necessary to lay waste to our culture and create an america in her image or is it that shes created americas image she also has the instinct to preserve the humanity of her family  we dont do gifts she says when i ask her if she worries about her kids growing up with too much kanye and i talk about it all the time about not getting too much and trying to be as grounded and well rounded as possible she holds herself to the same standard i dont like presents anymore she says we just did absolutely nothing for our anniversary we spent two days in santa barbara and we slept then she remembers you know what i think we went to ihop thats what we did  and then she tells me this story a motherhood story its about the time last year in paris when she was held at gunpoint and bound and robbed in a hotel by masked gunmen well she tells me shed been scared to go on that trip she was afraid of a terrorist attack shed never experienced anxiety like that before she even went to a therapist about it and north sensing her mothers anxiety wanted to reassure her  she gave me a little plastic treasure box and she put her little jewels in it  like fake little plastic jewels  and she was like mommy this will keep you safe when you go to paris  it is something that despite all the jewels and calabasas houses and red carpet gowns and original basquiats and rollsroyces and pairs of yeezy boots she has penetrates down into the depths of kim kardashian wests humanity which at least after spending a few hours with her i believe is very much there  to have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry she says she tells me she takes it everywhere with her  around us european businessmen sign their checks step into hushed elevators and are whisked to meetings with continental vampires kim k says shes going to see what north is up to im trying to figure out whats weird about seeing her in person at this phase of her life and i think its that she wears her crown lightly i guess its that shes chill which doesnt seem like the one word youd use for kim k i guess its that shes really a mom now she is a beautiful worldly 36yearold woman drinking the last of a cup of english breakfast tea before going out into the world to see to her empire with her fouryearold child at her side bearing witness to the domination but never expecting you know presents

72k shares share this story  the first debate showdown of republican nominee donald trump and democratic nominee hillary clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates  instead the viewing audience was treated to a onesided destruction with clinton appearing cool and presidential while trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support and clinton invited billionaire mark cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against trump in the media  there is no love lost between the two businessmen and cuban even said of trump there was no bigger jagoff in the world  the indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of cuban to being in debt at least 600 million the shameless trump who became more unhinged as the night progressed freely gave away one of his biggest secrets  that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years  clinton speculated about this and like a predictable rube under the hot lights trump cracked under the pressure rather than offer an explanation or deflection to clintons hypothesis trump agreed he paid no taxes and said that makes me smart trumps cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate  an hour after the debate trump immediately began walking back his statement and denied he had ever said it this type of shamelessness is difficult to combat when asked  it sounds like you admitted you havent paid federal taxes and that was smart is that what you meant to say trump replied no i didnt say that at all  trump insulted every american who pays their fair share of taxes and cuban was not amused nor impressed after the debate cuban said  i get audited every year my taxes are  it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that i have to spend and i tell my tax lawyers and everybody you know take advantage of  do what the law recommends but im not against paying taxes and ill give you a perfect example when the dallas mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening i had the opportunity to go to dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything i didnt do it a couple years ago we had some issues in dallas i just wrote a check to the general treasury this year we had after the shootings in orlando i had concerns about the lgbt community in dallas i just wrote a million dollar check to the city of dallas to support a bunch of different programs im im the luckiest guy in the world theres nobody whos been as blessed as me and my family so far knock on wood is healthy and at some point you have to realize you have to give back and you have to realize that this is a country thats been great to us and you cant just take take take take take take  mcuban on trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart debatenight pictwittercomupnunatukv  stefan becket becket september 27 2016  the contrast between cuban and trump could not be more stark cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him while admitting he owes his success to society trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible while offering to pay back nothing did trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes no did trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes no  trump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent because if they did they would certainly not support him trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made chinese goods to which his name is affixed in trumps world there is a twotiered system one for him and one for everyone else  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

556k shares share this story  once again donald trump and the republican partys fearmongering about immigrants is proven false ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in chelsea new york city trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points  vilifying syrian refugees these attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country yelled trump at one of his notorious haterallies on september 19th  he later went on fox news and in one broad stroke painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole think of it hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are you know they have such hatred and sickness in their heart its sickness and its hatred and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in  in fact mr trump the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized american citizen  and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a sikh immigrant harinder bains he is the owner of the bar in whose doorway ahmad rahami decided to take a nap in when bains saw the mans face on cnn he did what any responsible citizen would do  he called the cops  i did what i think every american would have done my neighbor would have done the same thing any jewish christian sikh muslim anybody would have done the same thingim from sikh faith ive been taught always stand up against the atrocities any kind of persecution said bains to cnns chris cuomo  hes absolutely right  because our nation is a nation of immigrants all of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else and picking on syrian refugees because theyre muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from syria a paltry number of the 46 milion syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the syrian civil war none of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the united states  the chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 36 billion you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms mr bains actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets when immigrants feel accepted by a community it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would  for instance the orlando shooter was reported to the fbi by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of mateens radicalization racist trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground mr trump and his campaigns racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger he is the real threat to america  not refugee or immigrants  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

trump hints obama to blame for charlotte unrest but he also presented himself as someone who could heal americas racial divide  donald trump on thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in charlotte north carolina on president barack obama suggesting that the violent protests there show a wounded country that looks bad to the world  pausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in pittsburgh to address the charlotte unrest trump also presented himself as the man to heal americas racial divide  story continued below  before going any further today i want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country and it seems to be a neverending problem trump said america desperately needs unity and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times and weve had some tough times but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation  he called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement insisting that such actions hurt lawabiding africanamerican families most and proposed a national anticrime agenda to address what he characterized as a national crisis  he also vowed to make american cities safer by appointing the best prosecutors investigators and federal law enforcement officers and sympathized with police officers who carry an immense responsibility but must be trained properly respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing and he took a shot at obamas leadership or lack thereof  we all have to walk a mile in someone elses shoes see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country i mean its  we have some real problems and we do have a wounded country trump said many americans are watching the unrest in charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the tv screens others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand our country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the worlds leader how can we lead when we cant even control our own cities  trump who emphasized that it will be the 45th presidents responsibility to address this crisis and save africanamerican lives has made an attempt to gain support from africanamericans in recent weeks albeit through a narrative of poorly educated impoverished black people who live in crimeridden inner cities and who after years of democratic policies he says has failed them have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign  trumps overtures to black voters  often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences  have done little to dent hillary clintons 80point advantage among african americans and his sometimes hamfisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage only hours earlier he recommended a controversial stopandfrisk policy a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities to curb violence in chicago obamas hometown and made the unsubstantiated claim that drugs are a very very big factor in whats happening in charlotte  still trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure earlier thursday during a phone interview with fox and friends the republican presidential nominee said there just seems that theres a lack of spirit between the white and the black  i mean its a terrible thing that were witnessing he continued youre seeing it im seeing it and you look at what went on last night in charlotte  a great place  and you just see it  protests over the killing of keith lamont scott a black man who was fatally shot by police on tuesday turned violent on wednesday night leading north carolina gov pat mccrory to declare a state of emergency in charlotte  by thursday charlotte officials and scotts family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot  charlottemecklenburg police chief kerr putney told reporters that police believe scott was armed though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively putney said the video would be shown to scotts family but did not commit to releasing it to the public  at a press conference thursday afternoon attorneys for scotts family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it charles monnett one of the familys lawyers said the familys decision would depend on whether the video can somehow help us reach that truth  justin bamberg another of the familys attorneys said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where scott was shot bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that pictures pop up online all the time they come from different sources he said that as far as he was aware scott did not own a gun bamberg also confirmed that scotts wife was present when he was shot  at the end of the day my priority is the greater good of this family first that has to be understood bamberg said when asked why the familys legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public yes we want transparency we dont create the facts we live with the facts but you cant take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning  the obama administration meanwhile urged calm  but the president himself had not made a statement as of 500 pm et on thursday  attorney general loretta lynch addressed the difficulties her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions i know that these are difficult times and i know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers she said but i also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days let us seek all peaceful way forward  white house press secretary josh earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully  unfortunately weve seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and in some cases violence he said weve often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported  wednesdays violence erupted as residents outraged over scotts death and that of an unarmed black man in tulsa oklahoma last week looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown charlotte according to reports police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters several of whom were injured including one who was shot by another protester police said  i see it even going out theres such a lack of  theres a lack of spirit trump said theres a lack of something somethings going on thats bad and whats going on between police and others is getting worse  the real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order pitching it as the solution to the unrest in charlotte and outrage nationwide over policeinvolved shootings of black men who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot  well its wow here we go again trump said its very sad when you look at whats going on its very sad its very divided our country and its getting worse im not overly surprised to see it but its happening  trump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve wont solve this problem pointing to the ambush in dallas this summer when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more  if you look at dallas there was a dialogue they prided themselves on dialogue trump said and they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and you know that was  that was a pretty rough situation to put it mildly a terrible terrible situation that sounds good it sounds right but theres something deeper than that  whats necessary trump maintained is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation leadership he intimated is lacking from americas current leader  well it really has to be  you have to have law and order at the time you have to have you know you have to have a certain spirit a certain unity and theres no unity trump said you look at the level of hatred the you know the rocks being thrown and everything happening its so sad to see you know this is the united states of america i mean its so sad to see but theres just no unity there has to be a unity message that has to get out and it starts with leadership  but what trump didnt say explicitly his surrogates did former house speaker newt gingrich and former new york mayor rudy giuliani appeared in separate fox news segments in which they both slammed obamas lack of leadership  first of all its a tragedy that eight years after our first africanamerican president took office eight years after weve had two africanamerican attorney generals the gap and the hostility if anything is worse and i think thats a tragic failure of leadership gingrich said  but my guess is he was afraid itd make him a black president in a narrowing sense he added he could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and reengineer hope in these communities and instead he became the person who talked about you know the cambridge policeman was wrong and you know ferguson was wrong and why florida was wrong  giuliani said obama should have lectured americans on constitutional law wednesday referring to last fridays shooting death of terence crutcher who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer the former new york mayor acknowledged that that incident was a more difficult situation than what transpired in charlotte that belongs in the ambiguous troubling category  but even there you gotta say to people wait let the investigation play out the president of the united states should have said that yesterday giuliani said the president of the united states should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law that we presume people innocent and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else  authors

off message is donald trump qualified to be president in the most pivotal moment of 2016 these are the questions he must answer  hl mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician  down  likewise theres really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on monday as the first serious job interview for potential president donald john trump  an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of oneliners faux familiarity and universal celebrity  story continued below  yeah yeah yeah its a big night for hillary clinton too shes got a lot to prove for real namely that shes not the lying selfdealing crook many americans think she is  or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who dont like her that her virtues temperament and experience compensate for decades of assorted ick she needs to prove she can stand up to trump answer the usual emailfoundation questions convince whoevers still sellable on the idea stop instagramming a picture of your lunch millennials and listen up that shes not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second john roberts drops the swearingin bible  but the spotlight belongs on trump who is in need of a rigorous job interview clinton deserves the same but she is already the single most scrutinized parsed vetted investigated attacked and plaudited nonincumbent to ever seek the presidency shes been around forever making enemies since the internet was dialup cell phones were the size of skateboards and trump was engaged to marla maples  everyone makes the orange jokes but trump is something of a black box  running on a few big and broad ideas curbing illegal immigration ditching bad trade deals restoring american prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness hes bad with facts and the truth and perhaps worse takes perverse pride in being a d student who doesnt read books has the sketchiest sense of history doesnt read briefing materials and according to aides and ghostwriters cant even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing  these are not nasty biased liberal opinions they are facts based on reporting and trumps own public performances here are five questions trump needs to address on monday  but taken together they add up to one big one is donald trump qualified to be president of the united states  1 does he actually know  or care to know  the basic information needed to competently run the country  only one verdict of presidential fitness counts of course and thats a candidates capacity to get to 270 electoral votes in recent days trump  who swooned after clintons superb convention in philly  has closed to within the margin of error in many though not all national polls and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like ohio and iowa since aug 1 hes still the most unpopular candidate in recent history although clinton is number two with a bullet and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally but he can win fivethirtyeightcom the archaggregator gives trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing  his resurgence proves three political points  two of them we knew the third is a surprise to everyone except trump and his team the country especially the white workingclass parts is pissed clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and  lastly but not leastly  trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity developed late in the game to shift shape and shut up when he needs to  the first debate should be a pivot  from politicking to presidenting being a cunning candidate isnt remotely the same thing as being ready to rule  and we should be moving to the doris kearns goodwin phase of the campaign where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial it probably wont happen but a boy can dream  this is not to suggest that trump cant do the job ronald reagan another entertainer who forayed into politics was mostly a success but hes been judged as a performer up to this point and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence  trump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs  apparently he wasnt aware russia had annexed crimea until george stephanopoulos informed him recently he obliterated jeb bush that humbled patsy of the gop establishment in the debates  but bush if anyone had cared to listen punctured trumps bullyboy promise to impose tariffs on chinese products correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by beijing that could lead to a global depression trump wasnt aware of that fact or just didnt care  the caring part is kind of important if history is any guide in april i sat down with one of his longtime advisers roger stone who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme selfconfidence and supreme impatience all you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not said stone who has known the gop nominee for decades when you write something for him keep it short and staccato hes not going to read a 40page white paper on the economy zero chance of that its just too boring dont blame him i dont like it either so keep it simple and direct because thats the way he communicates  stone argued that trump isnt an ignoramus  just a cuttothechase decisionmaker who is a lightningquick study but george w bushs advisers speaking to biographer peter baker said that bushs unwillingness to ask probing informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in iraq and during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown president obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis  trumps capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless  but theres not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job  many americans might not give a damn that he knows what huds section 8 program is  and his failure to answer informational questions that clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screwthemedia base but dont people have the right to know what he actually knows trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms  by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate  2 does trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of american constitutional government  again this is not a given hillary clinton despises the press and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts trump who banned news outlets including this one from his events for most of the campaign routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and in february went so far as to say were going to open up those libel laws so when the new york times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace  we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because theyre totally protected  thats a new one for a presidential nominee as corey brettschneider wrote in politico magazine last month for more than 50 years the supreme court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet they must show that the outlet acted with actual malice  that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not  during a private meeting with hill republicans earlier this year the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for article 12 of the constitution the framers stopped at seven he was just listing out numbers said congressman blake farenthold rtexas a trump backer at the time i think he was confusing articles and amendments  ok lets write that one off as a gotcha  you can understand constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse but consider his reaction to the paris bombings last november when trump told fox news he thought the government should shutter some mosques where some bad things are happening the comment was decried by constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds  3 why wont trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts  hillary clinton has appropriately has come under intense scrutiny for her sixfigure speeches to big wall street firms like goldman sachs  and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats and serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the clinton foundation the state department and bigmoney foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism  but the clintons have released all of their tax returns in part because for many years they were required to do so as government employees and trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one  why does it matter because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his privatesector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof in the same way that clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the white house senate and state department at issue is trumps fundamental personal narrative and his claim that hes very very rich he is but maybe not quite as much as he claims he says hes good for 11 billion forbes and other outlets say hes worth less than half that much  more serious is the issue of trumps debts the clinton campaign citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in china and elsewhere has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords if thats a lie theres an easy way to prove it  by releasing the returns  this isnt a liberal media witchhunt many republicans including supporters like house speaker paul ryan say he needs to cough them up and fast  4 whats the deal with his charitable foundation then theres the matter of trumps sloppily run and lessthanmagnanimous foundation in exposé after exposé washington post reporter david fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of overpromising donations and the misuse of funds including a quartermillion payment to cover legal fees for trumps businesses and sports memorabilia that trump himself has conceded might be illegal  the problem yet again is that trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity according to the reporting of fahrenthold and others  5 why lie these days the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs if presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny the only person allowed on the debate stage at hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system  but if trump is to be vetted for the presidency he needs to be asked not only about individual statements hes made in the past but his pattern of lying stretching the truth and bungling facts  hillary clinton crooked hillary in trumps parlance it bears repeating is no saint  far from it  and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading bordering on the untruthful and flatout lies in the view of gop congressional investigators  but its a crowning irony of 2016 that the republican party whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness  especially george w bushs claims about iraq  would nominate the most brazenly truthchallenged candidate in recent history a recitation of trumps whoppers would take up too much space  read politicos comprehensive donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths for a taste  in an attempt to defend trump buddy newt gingrich who lobbied to be trumps running mate tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts clinton the former speaker wrote is a fox who knows many things you can fact check trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing  but getting the facts right  and telling the truth  is a big thing its the only way citizens will ever look up to and not down on their leaders  authors

 does drakes new single mean hes already done with his most recent album  just over one week ago drake surprised the world by announcing a new single was on its way and then by dropping said track just a few days later in the middle of a louis vuitton runway show in paris for those who didnt get an invite to the exclusive event signs was uploaded to spotify shortly thereafter and since then its been streamed millions of times and discussed at length across social channels  the new drake track sounds like it could be the next big hit for the hiphop superstar who obviously wants to own the summer in the same way he did last year with his first no 1 hit as a lead artist one dance signs has yet to hit the hot 100 but it will in a short time and it could grant the rapper another serious smash  many people have started wondering what the release of this new poppy offering means for drake who is only a few months removed from his last charttopping effort on the billboard 200 as always he has been mum on the subject but there is plenty of precedent in his past to suggest that a new collection could already be in the works from the biggest name in music  over the past few years drake has sped up his release schedule and he never allows much time to pass in between one album and the next or whatever hes calling them these days he dropped two mixtapes in 2015 an album in 2016 and less than a year later in march 2017 his playlist project more life topped the albums tally with ease all of those items were massive moments in music and successful in terms of sales and especially streams and while he could have kept them alive and promoted them more intensely drake doesnt seem concerned with the shelf life of his music instead focusing his energy on creating more and more content  it might only be a few months old but the superstar grammy winner seems to have already moved on from more life even though it remains inside the top 10 on the billboard week after week he hasnt gone out of his way to do much in the way of promotion and while every track featured on the collection initially charted on the hot 100 only two have managed to hold on and neither is currently residing inside the top 40 any longer  drake also has a habit of mixing timelines and pushing more than one project simultaneously which would likely be disastrous for any other artist back in july 2015 he unleashed hotline bling which would quickly go on to become one of his highestcharting efforts and something of a signature song just a few months later he and future dropped their collaborative mixtape what a time to be alive which confusingly didnt feature bling that song wouldnt end up on a collection until nine months later when views finally conquered the world the name drake turned out to be powerful enough to keep both the song going and to send what a time to be alive to the top of the billboard 200 without issue so now he knows he can balance two different projects at once  at the moment signs is currently being pushed as a standalone single but in drakes world that could change in a moment depending on how well it performs on the charts and how long it is able to last it could wind up serving as the lead cut from an upcoming album or mixtape or playlist project or anything really drake has established himself as not only one of the most successful artists of all time but also one of the most unpredictable which is what is required by todays fastpaced music industry
