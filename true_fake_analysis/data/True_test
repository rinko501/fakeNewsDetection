as donald trump courted africanamerican voters in cleveland on wednesday at a town hall taped by fox news to air thursday evening he seemed to express support for establishing the stop and frisk policing policy on a national level  when asked by an audience member how he would stop violence in the black community trump responded i would do stop and frisk i think you have to we did it in new york it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and you know you really help people sort of change their mind automatically  he added new york city was incredible the way that worked so i think that could be one step you could do  the law enforcement policy  in which police officers stop and question pedestrians regardless of whether they believe a crime has been committed then search the pedestrians if the officers suspect violations  has been extremely controversial particularly in communities of color and has been the subject of several legal challenges alleging racial profiling and discrimination the policy gained prominence in the 1990s under new york city police commissioner bill bratton and mayor rudy giuliani who is now a close confidant of trumps  trump previously expressed his support for the policy praising giuliani for its success in new york trump has as of late also been an ardent supporter of profiling regarding immigration believing it is a helpful tactic in stopping terrorism  he has drawn the ire of some africanamericans not only for praising stop and frisk but also for painting a grim portrait of black life  on tuesday night trump said our africanamerican communities are absolutely in the worst shape that theyve ever been in before ever ever ever  seeming not to take into account slavery institutional segregation or the often violent reactions in the civil rights movement  on thursday morning however in an interview on fox  friends he sought to amend his position saying he never meant to suggest that stop and frisk should be implemented nationally  now chicago is out of control i was referring to chicago with stop and frisk trump said  his initial answer came in response to a question that did not mention chicago though trump cited the city in a previous answer as a place that is out of control  of course as president trump would not be able to unilaterally implement the policy in a single city he would have to defer to local officials and law enforcement  during a press conference the members of the congressional black caucus were asked about trumps stopandfrisk remarks the notion that stop and frisk had anything to do with the improving public safety numbers in new york is ludicrous and donald trump needs to check his facts said rep hakeem jeffries dnew york  we would ask donald trump to bone up on his knowledge of what is constitutional and what is unconstitutional said rep yvette clarke dnew york

as my 25th wedding anniversary approached i tried to be creative in buying gifts for my wife i had the idea of a silver coin that marked 25 years of something or other i went to a local coin shop and as i idled over some of the display cases i noticed a set of coins from the mid19th century oddly the coins from the 1840s and 1850s were largeup until 1857 when the coins started becoming at best half the size of the others  oh the panic of 1857 the owner said when i asked him about the change of size it was really bad the president didnt seem to have any solution except to use less gold or silver in the coins  story continued below  now that is inept presidential decisionmaking during the current election campaign there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth over the possibility thatwhoever the winner ishe or she will be so terrible as a leader they will bring down the republic as the worst president since independence and before the current candidates were known the two most recent white house occupants barack obama and george w bush have been consistently reviled by their detractors as the worst men to lead the country  but obama and bush can both take heart and donald trump and hillary clinton can gain solace perhaps from knowing that no matter how badly they do they almost certainly wont rank last by my reckoning that place belongs to james buchanan genial a man though he was ive made quite a study of him my innocent encounter at the coin shop only reinforced my lifelong determination to take an offbeat look at lets say the lesser presidents my father was definitely the only one in our suburban neighborhood with a biography of franklin pierce everywhere we went he forced me to read historical plaquesstopping the car in a shrieking halt at times to view them if i were to write a book about a president it surely wouldnt be about washington or lincoln or even silent cal coolidge it would have to be about someone as ineffectual as possible  buchanan the only president from my native state pennsylvania turned out to be my man  start with his anemic minimalist solution to one of americas great financial downturns  for a long time before buchanan in effect precipitated the panic of 1857 things were going well for the country at least in an economic sense there had been a bad downturn 20 years before with multiple causes like war in europe the dissolution of the bank of the united states and overspeculation in oddly enough slaves and western land the great acquisition of land under president james knox polk from oregon to california to texas reinvigorated the economy and a boom lasted for the next two decades railroads were the big player since so many people wanted to move west into the new territories and states manufacturing boomed domestically and then with foreign trade as well since europe had quelled many of its hostilities and american items were cheaper than those on the continent  then the day before buchanan took office congress passed what he wanted the tariff bill of 1857 which lowered tariffs on a panoply of items from abroadbuchanan wanted to stimulate foreign tradebut made american manufactured goods of the same sort less competitive  three days later came the real fatal blow though the dred scott supreme court decision which fell on the shoulders of buchanan the case had wound through state and federal courts for at least a decade but roger taney the supreme court chief justice and a fellow alumnus with buchanan of small dickinson college wanted it settled  scott was a slave to a military man who at times was stationed not in his native missouri a slave state but in the northwest territories which were nonslave after his master died scott brought the case that he should be free because he had lived in nonslave territory buchanan wanted to be a hero and thought if the case could be decided broadly it could settle the question of slavery in the union for good  buchanan knew too though that the court had five southerners and four northerners and if the decision were split that way it would be ineffective he and taney had apparently agreed to have a narrower decision or remand the case back to the appeals court if it were merely sectional since they felt the need to have some sort of bipartisanship for the decision to be legitimate  ignoring the idea of separation of powers though buchanan browbeat robert cooper grier another dickinson alumnus and a justice from pennsylvania to go along with the majority opinion which taney would write eventually a new york native justice samuel nelson wrote a concurring opinion making the vote even less sectional  legend has it that taney on the capitol stairs just before he gave buchanan the oath of office at the inauguration told buchanan that the decision would become public in the next few days buchanan apparently changed his speech to indicate thatand that he would be all for whatever the court decided  two days later the decision came down taney castigated scott whom he said was not a citizen being a slave and thus could not bring any suit he also wrote that the constitution gave no state or territory the power to institute or conversely prohibit slavery thus all the compromises about it going back to the 1820s were invalid and in fact the fugitive slave law requiring anyone who knew about it to return slaves to their owners anywhere in the country was in force  historically experts rate dred scott as the worst decision in the courts history but short of that it was at the very least transformational for the countrywith not just taney but surely buchanan responsible for it  as appalled as most of the country was about the morals of the decision at the time there was a practical downside too now no one knew whether he or she wanted to go west to use the railroads or to start a business that railroads might profit from railroad stocks started to decline in value and then a contagion hit and it was free fall by midsummer no one could take a ride on the reading as uncle pennybags does in the monopoly game since the reading railroad had shut down as did lines now and then famous like the illinois central several lines like the delaware lackawanna and western and the fond du lac railroad in wisconsin declared bankruptcy  thousands were thrown out of work and banks started foreclosing on loans and property senator william seward the leader of the new republican party come home from a vacation to find out he had lost most everything he ownedhis stock in the illinois central promoted to him by his rival democrat stephen douglas was virtually worthless  every bank in new york city effectively closednone would convert coins or gold into bank notes the oldest grain company in new york nh wolfe and co failed in august as did the most prominent insurance business in the country the ohio life insurance and trust co  buchanan and his administration did nothing to stem the public hysteria calm words might have quelled it but his inaction only made for further runs on banks and thus more turmoil in markets  the residue that mattered most though was the reaction caused by dred scott instead of promoting unity and opening up the west to more settlement as buchanan had thought dred scott thwarted it and brought an end to years of northern prosperity  yet the south did not succumb as badly its agrarian culture was selfsustaining and its cotton still had a market in europe there was a surge in arms sales there as well the economic downturn in the north exacerbating regional tensions the relative good times in the south caused northerners of all parties to further blame buchanan for being a southern lackey  buchanans response was underwhelming almost disdainful he said the federal government could do nothing in his annual message in december 1857 he said he sympathized with the travails caused by the panic but he would do nothing for individual suffering the government would continue to pay its obligations and would keep going on whatever public works projects it had started but would begin no new ones he said too many people had speculated in land and slaves and the like and deserved the gamblers fate eventually he noted the youth and energy of the rugged american individuals would triumph though there would clearly be an interim of rough times  in a sense he was right because it took the rugged young americans who went to war in 1861 to bring the economy back  throughout his term when a fork appeared in the road buchanan managed to take the wrong turn when hostilities flared in kansas over whether that territory would enter as a slave or free state buchanan wavered over which of two proposed constitutions would be valid exacerbating the killings some done by the wildeyed antislavery radical john brown when later brown seized arms with a small cadre of followers in harpers ferry west virginia just 40 miles from washington along the potomac buchanan again diddled before consulting robert e lee who had fortuitously been home in arlington on leave from his post in texas lee quickly went to harpers ferry to capture brown and quell the raid  in other ventures though buchanan dashed troops out on strange and unproductive missions he caused chaos in utah quelling what he thought to be a mormon revolt causing villages to be burned to the ground and dozens of lives lost over what was merely a jurisdictional dispute he supported mercenary william walkers forays to conquer nicaragua and guatemala and sent troops to try to annex parts of paraguay primarily to acquiesce to his southern base that wanted more slave states to come into the union then there was the little known pig war started when a settler along the canadian border on the san juan straits in the northwest shot a pig owned by the hudson bay co that wandered onto his property a standoff ensued until buchanan sent troops otherwise guarding kansas where there was a real problem out to calm the nonfatalexcept to one pigbattle this was at a time when there were about only 12000 soldiers in the us army stretched as thin as could be  as the election of 1860 came close buchanan refused to support the one democrat who could win stephen douglas because he just plain didnt like him that caused the party to split into three factions each nominating a candidate virtually ensuring republican abraham lincoln the election  the southern states which had threatened secession started doing so during the interim between lincolns election and his inauguration in march thus under buchanans watch buchanan took the unusual position that the constitution did not allow secession but the president could not do anything to prevent it  as the first halfdozen states seceded buchanan lost several cabinet membershe had a lot of southern alliesand refused entreaties by many including former president john tyler who would himself become a confederate congressman to find compromises to bring the wastrel states back into the fold  meanwhile buchanan allowed the seizure of armaments and forts by the seceding states and suggested the abandonment of the one major fortified island in the south fort sumter  enter lincoln who has long been rated in serious surveys and schoolmarms speeches as the greatest of presidents lincoln no doubt was a man with plans and savvy but i contend that the bar was set so low by his predecessor that maybe if there were no james buchanan the worst president ever there would have been a few notches more on the presidentialrating scale for abe lincoln to climb  today george w bush is often rated one of the worst presidents in history thanks to his authorship of the iraq war and his presiding over the crash of 08 and the beginning of the great recession obama is sometimes seen in the same light especially by the far right but as happened with honest abe and his predecessor perhaps that low bar will only make it easier for a president hillary clinton or a president donald trump to shine  robert strauss is author of the forthcoming worst president ever james buchanan the potus rating game and the legacy of the least of the lesser presidents

ap photo mcconnell pelosi ryan seek deal on government funding impasse a total of 170 million for the flint water crisis is added to the wrda bill  speaker paul ryan senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house minority leader nancy pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the sept 30 budget deadline fast approaches  in a series of threeway discussions on tuesday night the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until dec 9 in turn republicans would provide an ironclad commitment that funding to address the water crisis in flint michigan will be included in the water resources development act which covers hundreds of federal water projects  story continued below  late tuesday congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multilayered discussions pelosi and ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about 170 million in federal aid for flint  the amendment represents a bipartisan agreement between speaker ryan and leader pelosi to allow germane authorization language to be added to wrda as an amendment that will at the end of the day provide the necessary funding flint needs in the final wrda conference report a pelosi aide said late tuesday night the water resources legislation could head to the house floor as early as wednesday  pelosi and other democrats had refused to support any continuing resolution or a cr to keep the government open without the flint funding ryan for his part faced problems rounding up gop votes for a shortterm funding bill  with ryan and pelosi holding direct talks a deal was expected soon to break the impasse mcconnell and pelosi had also held discussions on the flintwrda issue said gop and democratic sources mcconnell had been pushing to include flint funding in the wrda package meanwhile senate minority leader harry reid dnev had been making his own insistence for flint aid clear with republicans  earlier senate republicans had been considering stripping louisiana disaster aid money from the stalled stopgap spending bill which in theory could have resolved senate democratic objections to the legislation and ultimately stave off a government shutdown at the end of the week that proposal had come after democrats voted tuesday to reject the stopgap spending measure  which would keep the government open until dec 9  because the package provides money for louisiana and other states but did nothing to address flint  mcconnell had been expected to unveil a revised legislative text with no louisiana disaster relief one senior gop leadership aide said but any formal action will now wait until wednesday the kentucky republican floated the idea at a news conference tuesday shortly before the procedural vote failed 4555 far short of the 60vote threshold  we keep hearing that their position is no flint no floods mcconnell said thats certainly an option worth discussing  informed of that comment reid told reporters he wanted to see exactly what mcconnell would do and again said democrats wanted relief for both louisiana and flint  but other democrats suggested the move would pave the way to a resolution if louisiana were not in there it would reduce the profile of disaster aid in this bill and that would be helpful said senate minority whip richard durbin  theres still really deep felt feelings by our michigan senators and many others that this is just fundamentally unfair to the victims in flint and we dont trust the house to help at all durbin added  house minority whip steny hoyer also said democrats wanted assistance for victims in both communities but that they would likely back a socalled continuing resolution that included aid for neither i doubt that we would turn that down he told reporters hoyer said democrats would insist the legislation still contain 11 billion to combat the zika virus which has long been stalled on capitol hill the measure also includes popular provisions to fund veterans programs and implement a july law to curb prescription opioid addiction  senate republicans had argued that the proper place for flint aid is water infrastructure bill moving through congress the senate passed the water resources development act which includes 220 million for flint and other communities with failing infrastructure on a 953 vote earlier this month  why do you feel as if you have to punish people in louisiana who are digging out from a flood  sounds kind of crazy but they have mud in their home they have to dig out  for flint when theres a pathway forward on flint through the wrda bill argued gop sen bill cassidy who has repeatedly pressed the need for flood aid for his home state of louisiana  still despite vows from some senate republicans that flint aid will be included in any final bill negotiated by the house and senate in a lame duck session democrats had been skeptical  meanwhile democrats also objected to language in the stopgap bill that continues a prohibition on the securities and exchange commissions ability to require corporate disclosure of political spending but that provision has been a secondary issue to the fight over flint  mcconnell and reid each accused the other of bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown but few think such a politicallydamaging scenario would take place just weeks before the presidential election if the senate is able to pass a funding bill the house would be expected to follow suit relatively quickly  among the 45 votes in favor of the bill were four democrats including those representing conservative leaning states like jon tester of montana joe manchin of west virginia and joe donnelly of indiana as well as bill nelson of florida where the zika virus is spreading quickly  thirteen republicans joined most democrats in voting against the bill including conservatives ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah and south carolinas lindsey graham cruz led a failed fight to include language blocking the obama administration from relinquishing oversight of the internet domain system to an international body graham promised to oppose the bill because it would not lift financing restrictions on the exportimport bank  heather caygle rachael bade and annie snider contributed to this story

angelina jolie unbroken  i never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes angelina jolie says and thats ok because i know who i am and the kids know who i am  i never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes angelina jolie says and thats ok because i know who i am and the kids know who i am  los angeles  angelina jolie was sitting barefoot on the porch of her luscious new home explaining why she wants to save the world when duty called her youngest son knox 9 poked his little blond head around the screen door  shiloh needs you the boy said quietly referring to his middle sister who is 11  shi ms jolie called before disappearing with a whoosh of her black caftan ten minutes later she was back shilohs beloved bearded dragon vlad had fallen ill and was now to shilohs distress convalescing at the vets that will be the rest of my day ms jolie said settling into a cushioned patio chair learning all about the health issues of the bearded dragon  ms jolie went on to lament the imbalance of a world where californian pets get cushy care while millions of people the world over lack access to proper medical treatment it went unmentioned that she was saying this from her 25 million twoacre hilltop estate in a gated pocket of the los feliz neighborhood a home she bought for herself and her six children in the spring following her split from brad pitt  perhaps more than any other celebrity ms jolie 42 has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds shes both the glamorous alister whose every move is tracked in headlines angie and the kids left target because it didnt serve hot dogs read one recent newsflash and the humanitarian dogooder who has made more than 60 trips to the field as part of her united nations work apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure ms jolie has been enduringly hard to peg a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once  she is a peerless glamazon as well as the womens health advocate who told the world about her preventative double mastectomy she has a meticulously managed public profile yet professes not to care what others think she remains near the pinnacle of celebritys cruel pyramid even though her recent movies only made money when she was camouflaged maleficent kung fu panda she is obsessed over  if in the united states at least not exactly beloved  and fixed in the cultural firmament as americas vixen despite having a halfdozenstrong brood  and even though the public appetite for salacious details of her personal life has long eclipsed interest in the films she has directed ms jolie doggedly brings tough obscure stories to the screen three of the four movies she has made are set in wartime including her latest first they killed my father based on the true story of loung ung who as a young girl survived the cambodian genocide and is now one of ms jolies close friends  while ms jolies earlier movies garnered tepid reviews several critics have anointed first they killed my father her best yet it is told entirely from the little girls point of view in khmer and received a standing ovation at the telluride film festival where it had its premiere netflix was to begin streaming it on sept 15 when it will also open in a small number of theaters  ms jolie said she could not have made the movie had she not first directed in the land of blood and honey 2011 about the bosnian war and unbroken 2014 based on the true story of an american gi taken prisoner in world war ii she and mr pitt starred together as a married couple locked in a different kind of conflict in her 2015 drama by the sea  it wasnt a conscious plan of i was going to make war films its just what i was drawn to she said  ms jolie has an indelible connection to cambodia not least because it completely reordered her life before first visiting in 2000 to shoot lara croft tomb raider she had been a hollywood wild child a ravishing goth weirdo who at the oscars that year dressed like elvira mistress of the dark and locked lips with her brother she also got publicly hot and heavy with her second husband billy bob thornton and wore a locket with droplets of his blood around her neck  the grace and humility she saw in the cambodian people along with the lasting effects of the genocide threw hollywood life into unflattering relief  once you get exposed to whats really happening in the world and other peoples realities you just cant ever not know and you cant ever wake up and pretend its not happening she said your entire life shifts  she adopted maddox now 16 from an orphanage divorced mr thornton and threw herself into humanitarian and environmental work finding lasting inspiration in wartime survivors and aid workers  the real will to survive and the strength of the human spirit and the love of the human family becomes so present and thats how we should all be living ms jolie said when youre around it its quite contagious and you know to learn from it  the air pressed in hot and close as she spoke and the sun was climbing its way toward a broiling midday i was all but keeling over but ms jolie who adores the heat was as composed as a sphinx we soon moved to the airconditioned climes of her kitchen  ms jolie is a contained and poised presence yet also light breaking every now and then into lilting laughter she is as visually arresting as she appears onscreen the sculpted lines of her face alongside the soft os of her eyes and mouth make hers an otherworldly beauty though slight as a sylph she says she doesnt exercise beyond dipping into the pool with her kids and vaguely intending to someday jump on a treadmill  although it was still august the children  maddox pax 13 zahara 12 shiloh knox and his twin vivienne  had already begun home school they would be accompanying her to the telluride and toronto film festivals  maddox has an executive producer credit on the film  and were making up for lost lesson time working with tutors in various corners of the house learning among other things arabic sign language and physics  i asked ms jolie if she ever felt like the coach of a small team and she replied that more often she felt part of a fraternity  they really help me so much were really such a unit she said theyre the best friends ive ever had nobody in my life has ever stood by me more  that last sentence hung in the air perhaps a subtle allusion to or indictment of mr pitt who adopted maddox pax and zahara and is the biological father of shiloh knox and vivienne the dissolution of their 12year romantic partnership came last september after an incident aboard a private jet  purportedly involving mr pitt and maddox  prompted her to file for divorce  shortly afterward ms jolie and the kids moved out of mr pittss estate living in a rental for nine months as she struggled with the decision about whether to buy a new home  it took me a few months to realize that i was really going to have to do it that there was going to have to be another base regardless of everything she said her voice falling quiet and low as it would each time the subject of the split arose that there was going to have to be a home another home  the new house a beaux arts manse that was once the residence of the legendary filmmaker cecil b demille is a beaut with a library rolling lawns cascading fountains that burble into the pool and a view of the griffith observatory ms jolie had an elaborate treehouse built  more a parkour treehouse she said  and the kids helped decorate and pick out the furniture for the whole house they have an agreement ms jolie said that not everyone can agree on everything but you have to try to like it if you dont hate it if you do hate it you can overrule  it has a lot of moments ms jolie said of the home its happy happy and light and we needed that  i asked how everyone is doing now  none of its easy its very very difficult a very painful situation and i just want my family healthy she said quietly  are they theyre getting better she said her voice approaching inaudibility  she intimated that first they killed my father might have informed her decision to leave mr pitt the film centers on ms ungs family members some of whom survived and ms jolie said she thought a lot about what family meant during production and how they should help each other and take care of one another the film is adapted from ms ungs 2000 book of the same name  loung had such horrors in her life but also had so much love and that is why shes all right today ms jolie said that is something i need to remember  determined to make the film as cambodian as possible ms jolie teamed with the cambodian director rithy panh who received an oscar nomination for his 2014 documentary the missing picture and enlisted thousands of cambodians as extras ms jolie said maddox was her righthand man working on the script taking meeting notes and bantering with mr panh in french some of the scenes were shot on massacre sites so the crew arranged for monks to pray and set out incense and offerings beforehand  she is very loved there said mr panh who served as a producer on the film he added that he was struck by ms jolies humility and how she intuitively communicated with the children on set despite her shaky grasp of the cambodian language ms jolie said a suggestion in vanity fair that children were cruelly hoodwinked in the casting process was a mischaracterization  ms ung said ms jolie who has cambodian citizenship shares her countrymens sensibilities in cambodia you dont raise your voice you speak kindly to people you greet people with your hands together and bow ms ung said all of this comes naturally to her  as our interview wrapped ms jolie joked that she would next work on a comedy i will get funny at some point she said adding that she was working on maleficent 2 a sequel to the disney fractured fairy tale that was a little funny she said wryly  ms jolie also seemed aware of how she might be beheld by the public the removed ice queen to mr pitts affable downhome missouri boy his revealing interview in the summer issue of gq style helped burnish his image as the more relatable one but she grew up a punk in school she said and was used to not fitting in and being someone people had opinions about  i never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes ms jolie said walking me down her driveway and thats ok because i know who i am and the kids know who i am  she quickly embraced me goodbye and i set off into the sun and the heat as the heavy security gate slowly drew shut behind

donald trumps reputation for being always available to reporters is way out of date  trump is saying yes to fox news almost every day but saying no to most other major networks and news organizations  a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee  he called into fox  friends on monday morning he is booked on the oreilly factor monday night and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday  rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump if nothing else it limits the candidates exposure to hardhitting questions  while fueling frustration among journalists  trumps surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than hillary clinton but that is no longer true  newt gingrich knocked clinton at a trump rally on monday afternoon by saying she doesnt do press conferences but clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks including as recently as monday morning  these sessions while relatively short have been plentiful while trump has not held a press conference since july  trump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought  especially since trump made clintons eightmonth period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point  its been more than 50 days since donald trump held a press conference david martosko of the daily mail tweeted monday  trumps recent tv appearances on the dr oz show and the tonight show made news but not in journalistic settings  the washington posts robert costa had a newsmaking interview with trump last week but thats the exception to the rule the new york times last had an interview with trump about a month ago  trump last appeared on cnn in late august because anderson cooper challenged trump about the candidates muddled stance on immigration the posts callum borchers concluded that it didnt go very well for trump  it went so not well in fact that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide its best to dodge the likes of anderson cooper and chuck todd  or for that matter chris wallace and bret baier  and stick to softball sessions with sean hannity and the fox  friends crew borchers wrote afterwards  trumps last time on nbc was the commander in chief forum on september 7 moderator matt lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with trump  related behind the scenes nbc execs concede matt lauer forum performance was disaster  the candidates last time on abc was a short interview with david muir on september 6 his last time on cbs was a 60 minutes sitdown with lesley stahl on july 17  trump does have another cbs interview in the works a campaign spokeswoman said  tv networks are agitating for more interviews with both trump and clinton the difference between the two is that trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time  this accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps  trump used to be very very accessible to the press at the beginning of his campaign he was extremely accessible cnn politics reporter jeremy diamond said on sundays reliable sources you could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies and that has really changed  diamond said he is less accessible i think in many regards than hillary clinton at this point  trumps campaign declined to comment monday on its media strategy republican communications strategist ron bonjean said most candidates in trumps position would be trying to reach a a broader general election audience  however most americans already know trump as a household name and he doesnt need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure bonjean said trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience  this conservativefocused media strategy is also gaining attention among trumps critics he pretty much exclusively appears on fox news now judd legum editor of the liberal news site thinkprogress tweeted on monday  trumps relationship with hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator  according to tvnewser wednesdays town hall will focus on issues and concerns surrounding africanamericans this election cycle  according to nielsen data only 15 of hannitys 2 million nightly viewers are african american overall at any given time of day about 2 of fox news viewers are african american
