one of the things that the bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the lords name in vain in fact one of the ten commandments in the old testament states you shall not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain exodus 207 the word vain means for no reason or useless  thus god was instructing the israelites to avoid using his name in a useless disrespectful way instead the israelites were supposed to revere the name of god and use it in a serious considerate way many of the ancient israelites were so respectful of the name of god that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used because they thought that any quill that had written gods name was holy and should not be used for regular words  dr john hagee the founder and senior pastor of the cornerstone church in san antonio texas not only agrees with what the good book says but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism speaking exclusively with newslo hagee stated that in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should  saying the lords name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now even in churches all across america hagee elaborated but thats precisely the problem if the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong what is the flock supposed to do follow in their footsteps i dont think so the flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself  the pastor reprimanded but nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look including houses of god which are the holiest of places  asked how the situation could be bettered hagee replied well wed have to start with ourselves as with everything in life if youre asking about my personal opinion there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using gods name than women who use it during sex that is one of the filthiest most derogatory and sinful uses of the lords name i can think of if it were up to me i would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail that would be a fine example of gods wrath aimed at what is in my opinion a terrible misuse of our makers good namereligionlocom  comments  comments

kendall jenner why shes quitting kuwtk but remains proud of kylies spinoff show  kendall jenner continues to distance herself from the reality show platform that made her family a household name with sources stressing that the model wants to have a legitimate career  kendall jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years and as her brand continues to skyrocket so are her annual earnings through endorsements sponsorship deals and modeling contracts  seeing how well things have been going with her career kendall jenner sees no reason why she should remain on keeping up with the kardashians shes grown tired of sharing her personal life on television and now that shes working harder than ever before she doesnt even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore  from kendall jenners point of view the 21yearold wants to build a brand thats mainly focused on her modeling career sources say that by being on reality tv kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry  shes worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than kim kardashians little sister and while its paid off for her for the most part kendall jenner cant stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world  sharing everything about her life including who shes dating could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people to eventually become as famous and successful as naomi campbell or kate moss being on reality television is not going to cut it for her  kendall will still make some appearances here and there in kuwtk and in kylies new show but only when shes in town and around  she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible an insider tells hollywood life  for now she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on kuwtk along with her sisters forthcoming reality show life of kylie but her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely saying that its no longer where her mind is at  kendalls modeling career is going really amazing and shes worked so hard to be taken seriously she feels like shes finally getting there and that shes now being booked because shes kendall the model not just one of the kardashians kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her it was a great springboard for her but at the same time it was a hiderenceand its not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life  last month the e network confirmed that kylie jenner had landed her own spinoff titled life of kylie variety reports which is expected to premiere in july  the series will follow kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire thats focused on beauty and cosmetics  kylie cosmetics her reputable company is already said to make millions in profit each month and while kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show kendalls little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with tyga  anything that could potentially make kendall jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from so if theres any sort of drama or tension on kylies show kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesnt want to be seen in that light  do you think its a wise move for kendall jenner to ditch kuwtk in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity
138k shares share this story  s trumps number one backer in silicon valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination the us department of labor filed suit charging that palantir technologies the palo alto technology company controlled by republican businessman peter thiel accusing him of systematically discriminating against asian job applicants in the companys hiring process palantir is a federal government contractor to the nsa  sources say that donald trump wants to deliver a lifetime supreme court nomination to thiel who despises the first amendments protections antitrust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy both the stanford law school grad thiel and trumps campaign later denied the report vanity fair noted that  according to the lawsuit palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions 73 percent of those who applied were asian ultimately the lawsuit says the company hired four asians and 17 nonasians the likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion the lawsuit says  ironically peter thiel the trump donor who bloomberg called the republican nominees most unlikely supporter is himself a first generation immigrant thiels parents came to america to find work in a high tech field but now hes supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether  thiel was a paypal cofounder and early facebook investor but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year the billionaire revealed himself in march to be hulk hogans secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted gawker in retaliation for revealing the billionaires thensecret sexual orientation  but now the entire world knows mr thiel prefers male company after he delivered a very personal political address at the republican national convention in cleveland thiel then called out the gops bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said every american has a unique identity im proud to be gay im proud to be a republican after a lengthy rant against government incompetence he became the first ever openly gay speaker at the rnc to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais and only the second speaker to be openly gay period  unfortunately his own party didnt pay much attention to the speech which was surprisingly well received inside the hall as you can see below because they passed the most antilgbt platform in party history this year which speaks volumes when you consider that the bush administration used antimarriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s  federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination said the department of labors ofccp director patricia shiu our nations taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers lisa gordon a spokeswoman for palantir said the company will defend itself vigorously and denies allegations of bias in a statement to bloomberg news  now the executive who accused his employer  the federal government  of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his companys hiring practices were competent in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

theres already been hints from nbc news that lester holt the moderator for the first presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton will not be fact checking the candidates this of course will allow trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable  except by hillary clinton  but to make matters worse all cable news networks including those critical of trump are pledging to be completely spineless and will not offer any onscreen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong  while onscreen factchecking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks including univision and telemundo said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics  thus the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to holt the only other person on the stage  after politico documented that trump lies on average every threeandahalf minutes one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest open debate on the issues but sadly the media realizing their ratings are on the line would rather kowtow to donald trump and his band of deplorable surrogates  the clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold trump accountable with clinton campaign communications director jennifer palmieri telling reporters  for the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give donald trump an unfair advantage we do believe it is the role of the moderator  to call out those lies and to do that in real time  unfortunately with trumps impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods its somehow up to hillary clinton to shine at the debate if she hopes to win this double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history just to look slightly better than him is abhorrent  hopefully clinton will wipe the floor with trump on the first debate but with no one to back her up it may be hard convincing the american people that she did it  if there is one thing this election has shown us its that journalism is dying if not already dead  featured image via sara d davisgetty images

the recently installed ceo of donald trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him according to politico breitbart news chairman stephen bannon was charged with battery dissuading a witness and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a january 1996 incident in the couples southern california home  i was wondering when this would come up bannon told politico its been a while and given my current position at the head of donald trumps campaign i was curious to see how long it would take the democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down and while were on the subject im actually disappointed i honestly didnt expect them to take this long he said laughingly  asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said well look you know things like these are orchestrated right i mean no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that arent targeting them in the first place and the fact that this is happening right now like 20 years later i mean its just ridiculous why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so donald trump as well its so obvious i honestly find it hilarious  but once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer bannon said alright look thats the thing about marriage right you get to do all the things youre not supposed to in a relationship thats the whole beauty of it and just like theres no rape in marriage so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as youre doing it out of love as a matter of fact ill have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands and i dont mean that in everyday life im talking about when theyre performing their marital duties he argued  so thats why i find these charges preposterous theyre so idiotic that im not even sure how theyre still interesting bannon added because god made it very clear when you get married you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse and one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what and i loved my ex wife i loved her dearly i loved all of my wives but her in particular just as much as i love my twins to this day  and when youre in love everythings allowed i dont care what anyone says when you say the words i do and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger you belong to them in every way possible at no point did i exceed my marital liberties so why should i or worse why should donald trump be punished for it he concluded  sourcepoliticopscom  comments  comments

978 shares facebook twitter  i dont recall in any presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day not only is hillary clintons health constantly making headline but its also commonly a part of presidential polls the polls continue to show a hillary decline as hillary continues to show a health decline  here are the top takeaways from the poll  more than 40 of registered voters now believe that clinton is in either below average or very poor health according to the survey of 1501 people taken between september 12 and 13 thats a sharp departure from another morning consult poll taken just at the end of august when only 26 of respondents thought her health was subpar  the share of voters who think clintons health is average remained relatively flat at 28 in the new survey by contrast the percentage of the electorate who think trump is in either above average or excellent health actually ticked upwards from late august from 33 to 36 just 22 believe the same of clinton  voters are also keenly aware of the story with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about clintons potential medical issues  while hillary clinton is only 68 yearsold shes one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade my mom is in her 60s too but looks 20 years younger than hillary at least usually looking old or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems i cant see hillary as a hard drug user but lately i have grown suspicious of hillarys health the suspicion isnt from one particular thing its from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press  at one point it was reported that hillary was taking coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other maladys it was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of provigil which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from parkinsons alzheimers and multiple sclerosis even her assistant huma abedin was caught talking about hillary getting confused and needing naps of which she was probably severely punished  and then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out looking like she stumbled the coughing fits recently another damning picture came out with hillary unable to get up stairs alone while this picture alone wouldnt mean anything there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way    another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs    then there are pictures like this where hillary is literally being held up while talking it would be more rare to find a picture of hillary not holding onto someones arm    heres an interesting video on how the video of hillary passing out at the 911 memorial is being taken down from the internet page after page it is obvious that hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out if you see the pictures of her rallies there are not many people i believe that the events are purposely not being promoted so that her voter dont see her in person because she looks awful    and of course the coughing pictures america has never been so obsessed with someone coughing she might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the us ever not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives shes gasping for air its incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next cough cough hmhmm uck khoff khak khak gack  gasp excuse me president of the united states

michelle obama not leaving the white house  hillary clinton has terrifying new role for her  the idea that i might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the obamas is actually making me a little ill i was done with them after the first few days of the barack obama presidency but it would appear that hillary clinton has some roles for the president and first lady after her coronation election  what exactly is first lady michelle obamas legacy trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap or perhaps it will be the infamous for the first time in my life im proud of my country i personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her bringbackourgirls sign  but why remember her when one of the presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration  insert mechanical applause here  but what would her role be what is she even qualified to do  its not hard to figure out what hillary clinton wants her to do when you remember that clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up your children if you doubt that read this tweet   101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now  i mean how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children  for an additional wave of nausea read hillary go on and on about her faith and how it has led her to her progressiveliberal ideology  of course michelle obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids as reported by the washington post  back in february she said at a healthcare summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids either i do not have a one or twoyear horizon for this work she said i have a restofmylife horizon  this reeks of desperation is hillary trying to capture the i dont like hillary but i do like the obamas vote or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because you know racism or something  either way im absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of american children the government is not one gigantic parental unit nor should it be viewed as one that is an extremely dangerous idea to have as nothing good has ever come out of complete government control over the average citizen
