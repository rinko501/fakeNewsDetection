there have been many reports about the changes our planet earth could endure in the months and years to come but many of them didnt really pan out making us question everything we read on the internet but this time nasa confirms whats been circling the web recently  our planet earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in november 2017 starting from november 15 to november 29    nasa reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didnt know exactly when upon more detailed examination the astronomers from nasa confirmed that the phenomenon will start on november 15 at 300 am and will most likely last until november 30 445 pm  images 4jpg  according to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between jupiter and venus there was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by charles bolden head of nasa explaining the strange event to officials at the white house  according to the report during this specific period jupiter and venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree venus will move to the southwest of jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than jupiter venus bright light will heat up the gases in jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space this reaction will come in contact with our sun at 250 am on november 15th  once the hydrogen reaches the sun a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the sun increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees the whole process will generate so much heat that the sun will change its color into a bluish shade once this happens the sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature    as a result of this strange phenomenon the suns light will be seen much dimmer from the earth and hence the 15day blackout nasa is talking about    we do not expect any major effects from the blackout event the only effect this event will have on earth is an increase of 6  8 degrees in temperature the polar cap will be mostly affected by this no one should worry much this event would be similar to what alaskans experience in the winter bolden said

the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump mathematically guaranteeing him a presidential victory  abc news 18 share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency ap photo  dennis system  columbus oh ap  history was made today in columbus ohio when more than 3 million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november  the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee  the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process  over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 timothy 212 we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way  according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote  the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models  the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision  i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent  most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late  during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price  though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose 50 of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses  it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way  if you are interested in learning more about the amish community and the aab you can contact the pennsylvania amish heritage museum at 785 2730325 tags

breaking steps to force fbi director comey to resign in process  hearing decides his fate sept 28  the fbi investigation of the hillary clinton email scandal where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway has ignited a firestorm of criticism and it looks like fbi director james comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll comey gave immunity to all of hillarys top aides including chief of staff cheryl mills even though mills had refused to cooperate with the fbi throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination now the house judiciary committee has scheduled a hearing for september 28th that will decide comeys fate  former us attorney joseph digenova has loudly called for comey to resign and when that did not happen demanded that he lose his job this now gets to the point of a serious question as to the directors fitness for office digenova said he believes that the fbi should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for mills computer the contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the fbi because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity he said this was not a real investigation this was a protected investigation designed to look like an investigation  digenova demanded that congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently they listened this week comey will have to answer for his behavior   101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now  will congress hold comey responsible for this joke of an investigation he isnt just having to face a hearing hes been issued a subpoena from congress too  congress has repeatedly requested that comey provide certain documents on clintons email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them in a further attempt to get comey to comply lamar smith of texas has slapped comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents  how loyal is comey to hillary really is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her and if the answer to that question is yes then the new question becomes why

a string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23yearold case that had gone completely cold after a reporter for the washington examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf an investigation began into the death of clinton attorney vince foster fosters death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide    with new evidence rep trey gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of vince foster exhumed for autopsy the body wasnt autopsied before burial the first time which aided in the theory of a coverup forensic specialists examined the body last night at the naval hospital in norfolk virginia concluding that the cause of death for mr foster should be changed from suicide to homicide    lt col james mcfitting head of the hospitals forensics lab told reporters in his office that foster had not one but two gunshot wounds both of which would have been fatal there would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time the wounds were also in the back of his head meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time the original story was impossible    the doctor who signed fosters death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country never to be seen again without the letter from the reporter mr foster may have never seen justice    the case has been turned over to the fbi who has clear jurisdiction at this point for the difficult task of connecting the dots from fosters death directly to bill and hillary clinton director comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureaus resources are made available    in other words clinton will be getting away with murderagain

there is not a day that goes by that we dont hear about a muslim terror attack taking place somewhere in our world but that hasnt stopped leftists from defending them at every opportunity those of us that criticize the socalled religion of peace are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous muslims are in europe those that speak out against islam are being imprisoned for their belief courts are actually sentencing people for islam antiblasphemy laws while this may be par for the course in europe right now it is not the way we roll in america until now minnesota has just established a similar law  antiblasphemy laws are a huge victory for muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards sharia law  according to minneapolis local newspaper the startribune the hotline was set up as a way to target trump supporters who muslims believe are the group of people most likely to harass them the star tribune reported  the city of minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hatecrime incidents and other acts of intolerance  the service operated through the citys 311 helpline is aimed to aid targets of any harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice according to a city news release issued on monday  the announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting muslims and jews across the country many of which go unreported  since the general election many of us have experienced witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of racism xenophobia sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the united states minneapolis department of civil rights director velma korbel wrote in a statement posted on the citys website in no uncertain terms hatemotivated speech and actions have no place in minneapolis nor will they be tolerated  the citys department of civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this governmentenforced fascism as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state this hotline flies right in the face of our united states constitution where it goes to the heart of denying american citizens their inalienable rights of the first amendment which governments can not do of course the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the constitution or the rights of americans as they are using their position to establish a soft version of antiblasphemy laws in no uncertain terms hatemotivated speech and actions have no place in minneapolis nor will they be tolerated minneapolis department of civil rights director velma korbel wrote in a statement posted on the citys website  the department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of minneapolis mayor betsy hodges who went on to blast president trump pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office she stated i will not compromise the public safety of the people of minneapolis to satisfy trumps desire to put politics before public safety minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and i am grateful for their commitment to our city i stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the presidentelect prepares to take office the idea of an antiblasphemy hotline in america is pretty absurd but right up liberals alley why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us dont they want to protect their loved ones this is only the beginning of the democrats plans to take control of our country again but what they dont realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to muslims demands this antiblasphemy hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it it is very similar to nazi germanys approach in the 1930s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom what do you think share this with your friends and family  ht freedom daily

comment on hillary clinton campaign logo has a subliminal message by برنامه ریزی ضمیر ناخوداگاه adobochron 1 comment  san francisco california  the adobo chronicles san francisco bureau  now it can be told  now that hillary clinton is all but assured of the democratic presidential nomination  for months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid her campaign logo has always symbolized americas quest to move forward with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right lefthanded people of course dispute that symbolism because for them moving forward should be pointing to the left  but there is another school of thought about hillarys logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the conservative right as opposed to the liberal left  the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections  voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate  the gops presumptive nominee donald trump is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist which would give clinton the edge among conservative voters  who knew the placement or direction of an arrow could spell victory or defeat for an american presidential candidate rate this

did meek mill find nicki minaj in a lesbian tryst with young ma  finding a story about nicki minaj and meek mill isnt exactly a stretch last year meek mills beef with canadian rapper drake kept us entertained for months and minaj is hardly lowprofile over the past few years minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music as a result celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next meek mill and nicki minaj story in recent weeks most stories about mill and minaj have focused on whether or not hiphops power couple are still dating or not  in recent days rumors have emerged claiming that meek mill walked into minajs dressing room to find her and female rapper young ma in a lesbian tryst ace showbiz has speculated that meek mill and minaj split last month after meek lost his cool mill went on an instagram rant at minaj and then deleted his account the same site reports that mediatakeout claims minaj has become infatuated with female rapper young ma and has split with meek as a result  all hiphop claims that minaj plays for both teams and says that she certainly has rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bisexual or certainly bicurious  of course certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story and it seems that the latest millminaj split rumors are just exactly that  rumors with no credible evidence to support them indeed a glance at minajs instagram account suggests that meek mill and nicki minaj are very much together as they enjoyed halloween together nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with mill  gossip cop reports that the stories claiming mill and minaj have split are not only false they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers  the webloids perspective though continues to differ from reality minaj and mill are very much still together as she herself showed on instagram monday morning and while the relationship might not last forever minaj is not dropping mill for young ma mediatakeout should probably start looking elsewhere than twitter and instagram for its madeup stories  of course some might question why gossip cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to nicki minaj and meek mill after all they seem to rely on the images posted on minajs instagram account as evidence that meek and minaj are still an item one has to wonder if gossip cop sees the irony in this given that they invite another outlet to look beyond instagram for stories  many will wonder why minaj and mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories the truth may lay in minajs hunger for publicity according to hiphop dx minaj was recently quoted as saying that meek mills highprofile beefs with the like of drake are great publicity perhaps minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity  the reality is that the public has no right to know anything about mill and minaj that the couple doesnt want shared publicly it is easy to claim that minaj and mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry there is no doubt that artists like minaj and mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them some claim this makes them fair game for the gossip columns  the reality is that nicki minajs sexuality is her own affair and she should not be judged or slutshamed for it the inner workings of minajs relationship with meek mill are no ones business but their own

the announcement that mall of america was welcoming its first black santa claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind many were highly offended three years after foxs megyn kelly definitively explained to america that both jesus christ and santa claus were white men mall of america dismissed her advice and hired larry jefferson a retired us army veteran from irving texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors  among many who were offended by this move was former halfterm governor of alaska sarah palin the sharptongued republican wasted no time in condemning the companys actions going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and running mall of america into the ground on the basis of santa always having been white in the bible no i refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities i thought the company had some backbone but i guess i was wrong palin told the minneapolis startribune  she also argued that hiring a nonwhite santa claus was the last straw in corporate americas twisting of traditional conservative christian values because they realized they couldnt make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques theyve been using so far she added thats why they had to come up with something new and out of the box at least something that appeared that way in their minds but this proves that they have no morals and that they wont shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional christian values just so they could make more money i understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life but i dont understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that  thats why americans especially white ones need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again palin added the holy book always said santa claus was white and any kind of deviation from that regardless of its magnitude is a sin and we need to make an example out of mall of america if we dont if we let them get away with it whats next others will follow their example and the next thing we know were going to be having arab santa clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make ieds out of christmas lights i mean just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hiphop music you think thats happening by accident  nope our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional white christianity the numbers of converts to islam have also spiked just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups we are being bred out people and as innocent as it may seem a black santa is just the beginning she concluded

donald trump is well deplorable hes suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brownskinned rapists and drug dealers from charging into the country gotten on board with creating a national registry for muslims like hitler did with the jews forcing said muslims to wear special identification badges and even rounding them up into modernday concentration camps as a temporary measure hes even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad  the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families when you get these terrorists you have to take out their families they care about their lives dont kid yourself when they say they dont care about their lives you have to take out their families  but hes not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas he also wants to bring that idea home in a statement on the bombings in new york and new jersey over the weekend the donalds senior communications advisor explained that trump is not fighting terrorism  hes fighting the narratives of barack obama and hillary clinton and trumps narrative is kill them all  last weekends attacks which are just the latest to be carried out on us soil on president obamas watch should be a wakeup call for every american it is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full us citizenship because of the failed policies supported by president obama and hillary clinton even worse clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550 increase in syrian refugees and her push for an allout open border policy which will put even more americans at risk the threat from radical islamic terrorism has only grown under obama and clinton and isis has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational our enemies neither fear nor respect hillary clinton and as a nation that is dangerous and it is disgraceful mr trump will bring an end to these attacks because unlike obama and clinton he believes were in more than a fight about narratives  these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens  pay attention to that last bit they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens  now we already know that the problem according to the gop presidential nominee is radical islamic terrorism and that trump has numerous times blamed muslims in general for any attacks he could exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating terrorists  theyre protecting each other but theyre really doing very bad damage  they have to open up to society and report the bad ones trump said in march when they see trouble they have to report it they are absolutely not reporting it and thats a big problem  if muslims are protecting terrorists are they not terrorists in trumps eyes how many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows islam was rounded up would there be mass exterminations trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists families how would he define terrorism  these are all questions it is unlikely that mr trump will answer for himself  but remember he is exactly the sort of person who with a wink and a nod suggests disarming his political opponents security to see what happens to them shortly after suggesting that second amendment people could deal with them were dealing with an unstable constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the little red button that launches our nuclear arsenal  its also important to remember that the attacks in new york and new jersey were committed by an american citizen  one with constitutional rights no matter how much someone wants to call for blood this of course matters not to the donald  normally suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole but not with trump hes said it himself many times  if we allow this alleged human this oompa loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation  to assume office it will not end well be sure to vote in november if its the last thing you do if trump wins it may be  featured image via getty imagesjoe raedle

how intolerant can a group of people get folks  if they dont want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from this should apply universally to all who chose to migrate  wouldnt it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesnt offend muslims perhaps we could figure out why theyre risking their lives entering both america and european countries if western culture offends them so  according to the islamic activist group hizbuttahrir australia is enforcing democratic values and a disputed view of history which contradicts islamic beliefs according to their spokesman unthman badar requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values are a part of an oppressive campaign by australian authorities of forced assimilation of the muslim community  heres the pledge  from this time forward under god  i pledge my loyalty to australia and its people  whose democratic beliefs i share  whose rights and liberties i respect and  whose laws i will uphold and obey  pretty oppressive right if you are graciously accepted into a country and you cant even say that pledge is there any chance of assimilating into the culture heres the national anthem  australians all let us rejoicefor we are young and free weve golden soil and wealth for toil our home is girt by sea our land abounds in natures gifts of beauty rich and rare in historys page let every stage advance australia fair in joyful strains then let us sing advance australia fair beneath our radiant southern cross well toil with hearts and hands to make this commonwealth of ours renowned of all the lands for those whove come across the seas weve boundless plains to share with courage let us all combine to advance australia fair in joyful strains then let us sing advance australia fair  super oppressive lyrics right  if a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society they can go right back where they came from  moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country  if those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles they should not be allowed to enterits really that simple  watch hizbuttahrir spokesman unthman badar make the case against muslim school children singing the national anthem it begins around the 10 minute point  this is outrageous muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nations population because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy wqe cannot let them get away with these things  either assimilate or leave  they are muslim first last and always geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them their only loyalty is to allah its their faith the west doesnt get it because most liberals are faithless  it irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then dont want to be patriotic to that country how about you go back where your from next they will demand that australians convert or be beheaded  it makes me sick that our children were denied the american flag under obama and couldnt pray but muslim children can and do we are denied christ but they are not denied allah during school hours this is wrong on more than one level next they wont want to learn the country they have invaded history because its not theirs  muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to  this what you get with socialist politician bent on destroying their country  do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them
wells fargo attempts to gain control of your money  wells fargo has begun to put into play its plot to control consumer spending on monday it began roll out of a program intended to reduce the amount of people using physical currency by forcing its customers to only use digital currency the bank hopes to become the arbiter of when and where money can be spent unlike traditional physical currency transactions done digitally require authorization from the bank holding the funds thus whether or not your money can be spent and on what becomes the decision of the bank but it isnt only wells fargo moving in this direction the us government has long been pushing banks to move in this direction by doing so the government hopes to gain greater leverage of the populace it is no secret that police departments have been seizing bank accounts and money without any sort of due process but if all currency was digitized the government would not only be able to seize every time you own but they would be able to prevent you from earning more money by any means the government would essentially gain the ability to arbitrarily impose a death sentence on a citizen by preventing them from participating in trade at all wells fargo stands to gain from this because if all money is digital then all money must belong to a bank this is just the first step towards a more authoritarian american

is the queen preparing abdicate  his holiness pope benedict xvi announced it through the vatican to shock and surprise  a poised queen beatrix of the netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to youtube and king juan carlos of spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill  queen elizabeth however has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do  abdication is after all a dirty word in the corridors of royal palaces especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle edward viii quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twicedivorced wallis simpson  and there is no indication that that will ever change  yet with the queen now into her 92nd year and with the hardworking duke of edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96 plans are afoot which if implemented would see charles appointed king in all but name  palace sources have indicated that the queen has told her inner circle that if she is still on the throne at the age of 95 she will ask for a piece of legislation called the regency act to come into force  granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives  i have spoken to a number of highranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace they have all confirmed that a regency with charles taking the lead is now at the very least a real possibility  one senior former member of the royal household said out of the profound respect the queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship her majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over she is dutiful to her core  her majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes the transition of the crown is seamless  i understand the queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that if she is still alive at 95 she will seriously consider passing the reign to charles  clarence house  the household of prince charles  is making no comment about plan regency as it has been called however it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court  but palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be up to speed on the 1937 regency act which grants power to the heir apparent in the event of the incapacity of the sovereign through illness and for the performance of certain of the royal functions in the name and on behalf of the sovereign in certain other events  the development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court  a series of senior staff changes and departures at buckingham palace and kensington palace home to the young royals  the queens private secretary sir christopher geidt 55 resigned his position two weeks ago sparking turmoil and a wholesale regime change  as revealed in the mail on sunday  his shrewd deputy  former banker political adviser and television executive edward young 50  will replace sir christopher after a suitable handover period  i understand that a number of other highprofile figures  many loyal to sir christopher  are poised to leave the royal households at buckingham palace and kensington palace after his unexpected exit  they include assistant private secretary samantha cohen the capable former press secretary and sir christophers number three in the private office ms cohen who is australian is said to be a firm favourite with the queen  falklands and afghanistan veteran vice admiral tony johnstoneburt the master of the queens household is also said to be weighing up his position sir alan reid the keeper of the privy purse had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when prince philip stepped back from public duties leaving the job to his deputy sir michael stevens  at kensington palace the duchess of cambridge has hired a new private secretary catherine quinn who is head of the university of oxfords said business school it is understood she will take up her new role in october  prince williams private secretary former ministry of defence communications expert miguel head and prince harrys private secretary former blues and royals captain ed lane fox 40 are also said to be considering their options  perhaps significantly there have been no major staff changes at clarence house home to prince charles  of course the transition to a world in which significantly more royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way next month the duke and duchess of cambridge will step into their new roles as fulltime working royals and prince harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmothers side  as ever the queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss said the former member of the royal household of course for obvious reasons abdication is not even a consideration  that is not in doubt on her 21st birthday in 1947 the then princess elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts speaking from cape town where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister it was as unequivocal as it was momentous  i can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole empire listening she said i should like to make that dedication now i declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong  it was a conviction that she confirmed in her coronation oath on june 2 1953  while it may be acceptable for queen beatrix and king juan carlos to pass the baton to the next generation palace aides still believe the a word is not part of her majestys vocabulary  there is no escaping the passage of time however or the fact that the queen at 91 is the oldest and longestserving monarch in the history of these islands  one who is now without the company of prince philip her consort on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year  the monarch is in remarkable health yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian albeit one with incredible stamina can realistically be expected to achieve  charles has already been filling in for his mother representing the head of state on foreign trips during her diamond jubilee year to australia and new zealand  earlier this year he went in her place to canada to mark the nations 150th anniversary on a tour of the persian gulf he represented the crown and was treated like a king with other royals bowing to him  more will no doubt come as the queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties  a regency however would ensure a more formal handover  and indeed the act was considered in more recent times when the queen first acceded to the throne  documents show that following the coronation of 1953 the young elizabeth ii intervened to ensure that prince philip  and not her sister princess margaret  would take over as regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before charles then aged four reached adulthood this was not of course required  times have changed so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year what would it mean in practice today  certainly it is not be a decision to be taken lightly  to safeguard against a coup a regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following the sovereigns consort in this case the duke of edinburgh the lord chancellor david lidington the speaker of the house of commons john bercow the lord chief justice the incoming sir ian burnett and master of the rolls sir terence etherton  clarence house and buckingham palace officials have played down this speculation as one would expect but as one insider told me we are in uncharted territory right now  a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power

when donald trump said that he wanted to ban muslim immigration until we know whats going on every single democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist  oh how wrong they were and still are  first off racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin islam isnt a race it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization this is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking theyll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins  the insanity in this issue is clearly on the side of the democrats after seeing how the world is working trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in  democrats think the world will agree with them and theyre flat out wrong well this has got to sting  a new poll has found that 49 percent of australians support a ban on muslim immigration a huge jump from last october when only 28 percent backed the idea the essential research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue and showed that two thirds of australians agree that populist senator pauline hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up the top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism and a belief that muslim migrants do not integrate nor share australian values the poll was first conducted in early august and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers  so australians want to preserve australian values that sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do yet when trump says america first its suddenly racist  ok yeah that sounds logical  sixty per cent of respondents who support the rightwing coalition favour an end to muslim migration along with 40 per cent of labour voters and 34 per cent of green voters floored by the results the pollster laments that the basket of deplorables who he previously thought were just a marginalised rump out of step with the views of modern mainstream cosmopolitan australia is too big to ignore he writes this not a basket of deplorables who sit outside the confines of polite society that is 49 of the men and women who make up our nation yes they are more likely to vote coalition or other but 40 of labor voters and one third of greens agree too look around you right now there are people in your workplace in your street on your train who agree with hanson  do you hear that hillary this is how you respond to people who oppose you you dont call them deplorables you recognize that half the country is against you lets get this done in november  source breitbart

it might be hard to believe after all many of us had used vick vaporub it seems like a harmless ointment effective for fever nasal congestion and many other affections  but this case will make people question its use especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them  a mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what shes living the loss of her 2yearsold baby  when she came back from work she came into her babys room when she got near to kiss him she felt he had a fever she imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him  she rubbed vick vaporub on his chest back and under his nose to help him breathe she tucked him up and laid down next to him  she was tired so she fell asleep next to her baby hours later when she woke up she noticed her son wasnt breathing  she carried him and took it to the hospital to save him but sadly everything was pointless the baby had been dead for hours  the medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment  she never imagined that home remedy would take his baby she only wanted to help him breathe and the ointment did exactly the opposite  the thing is this remedy is effective for adults however for babies younger than two years old the ointment increases the mucus by 60 the mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing  the label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old  sadly in the case of the mexican mother the warning went unnoticed using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world but we hope this story draw attention to this fact when children are concerned we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy  we must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness

66k shares facebook twitter  german chancellor angela merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would she is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction merkel told the media at a press conference  if i knew what change in refugee policy the people in germany want i would be prepared to consider it  these comments came shortly after the defeat of the christian democratic union in berlins sunday elections she also said  if i could i would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015 for which we were rather unprepared  she took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the mecklenburgvorpommern election callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader  the results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many germans now have as well as the rise of the anti mass migration alternative for germany known as afd these factors have forced merkel to at least consider a change in her stance  regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets in other words it is all talk and no walk she is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want  however she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the christian social union they have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into germany each year they specifically want to cap it at 200000 as well they want to prioritize christian migrants over muslims but merkle will not budge on that  merkel stated  if people dont want muslim asylumseekers purely because of their religion that is contrary to our party principles and to germanys the cdu and i cannot go along with that  christian social union party leader horst seehofer threatened to withdraw support for merkle during her 2017 campaign specifically for not implementing the migrant cap the campaign will be in the federal election he said  it is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election  the growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees understandably so if it aint broke dont fix it  this could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election or at least win by an only marginal amount serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as president obamas and hillary clintons she is no different which is why many americans too cannot stand her

president donald trump was very active on twitter easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns saying he shouldnt have to show them since he easily won the electoral college moments after he defended no longer calling china a currency manipulator now that they are giving him a helping hand with north korea trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on twitter i did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a republicaneasily won the electoral college now tax returns are brought up again trump tweeted    as always his son eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father during an brief phone interview with kyxl radio based out of orlando florida president trumps second son argued that his fathers tax return is irrelevant largely because he knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law especially when it comes to paying taxes he said when you come from a background like the one my father comes from you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place    eric continued and while were on the subject i kind of have to say its funny how taxes work they sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets thats kind of not fair what he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight the worst part is im not saying something thats revolutionary here this system has been in place ever since the country was established my father regardless of the fact that hes president is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system thats a catastrophe    the selfproclaimed businessman then revealed plans to fix the broken tax system of the united states at the end of the day its irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not it wont matter soon anyway eric argued asked to elaborate he said that president trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that cancels taxes for extra productive people in the us economy its our way of saying good job to all those hardworking men and women who are singlehandedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes it is to them that this country owes its gratitude they are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world    as for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax i can assure you there is no conflict of interest there this is not a move designed to make it so my father doesnt have to pay tax like i said its a sort of thank you from him to the entrepreneurs businessmen and other hardworking americans who have done their duties thus far as for the rest i guess theyll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work no more freeloaders thats where were going with this bottom line if youve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain you can sustain yourself and youre going to have to pretty soon eric concluded

52k shares facebook twitter  president obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal their is no denying that why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the affordable care act gun control and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees well apparently he has not changed his tune because president obama appeared at his final united nations general assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting president while there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about american freedom that will have most americans absolutely flabbergasted at  during his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order maintaining that the united states would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome he went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions such as the united nations for example  obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves but apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs he even admitted that amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right i hope hes enjoying that gilligans island by himself  how ridiculous he knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise that perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses washington dc right now if the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so its like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do then they wonder why they misbehave  watch president obamas full speech here

boom marines send terrorists scathing message video  theres a reason that its called terrorism its because isis and terrorist groups like them use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want with isis and other islamic terrorists what they want is to force people to convert to islam and live their lives subservient to their muslim rulers anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death isis even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their nonbelief  while the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most peoples hearts marines arent bothered in the slightest they welcome it actually because if the terrorists try to attack the marines then they dont have to worry about hunting them down not only are they not intimidated theyre rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists faces  a series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that marines are ready for them and it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the united states marine corps   101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now  considering how many terrorist attacks the united states has seen over the past year there couldnt be a better time for the marine corps to send this message to the terrorists liberals were furious over it naturally but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent americans from being able to defend themselves who cares what they think  and this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda remember what they want is to make people afraid these billboards show that not only are the marines not afraid theyre ready to take the fight to the terrorists if were not afraid then the terrorists lose  sorry isis game over  share this on facebook if you agree with this badass statement

43k shares facebook twitter  charlotte riots have gone mad the idiots there turned a peaceful protest into a firey lootfilled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun  go figure they cant even play the race card on this one but theyll still wreck a town for no reason  it makes sense now that the thugs in charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction what did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted  nothing but thugs wanna be thugs so this is what they do rather than get a job and start a family these losers knock up overweight women make multuple kids avoid childsupport payments like the plague and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police  ding ding the looter alarm sounds and all the jobless nodaddy thugabee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence why because another black man was an idiot who didnt listen to police  that must mean its time for the charlotte thugs to riot loot and lynch white people these thugs are such losers that they assaulted a cnn reporter the charlotte thugs are so stupid that they dont even know cnn is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every black lives matter thug  madworld news  rioters swarmed this mans injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention while they were addressing this situation the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another its okay with the blm for a black thug to shoot another black man but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation all hell breaks loose this proves that they dont know what they are rioting for because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do they wouldnt be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed  if i saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured then id probably pick them up i know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that theyd be the first person to run towards me and lift me up  black lives matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community theyre the extremely violent thugs of america who in between beating innocent people also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses  black lives matter supporters are the worst people of america  theyre a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association they call white people racist just because theyre white they attack people just because theyre white  they call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment how is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin they cant but as we grow we learn how to control our body emotions thoughts and actions  i judge black lives matter thugs and supporters on their actions and not the color of their skin  based off what ive seen so far i can proudly say fck black lives matter and the hoopty they drove in on

pennsylvania republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on election day in support of donald trump  first proposed in june house bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote  in other words it would legalize voter intimidation  as brennan center for justice counsel adam gitlin told propublica earlier this month poll watchers especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process  theres actually a risk that in a more disorganized way people are going to be showing up to the polls they wont know the law and theyll be engaging in discriminatory challenges gitlin said that can create the potential for a lot of disruption longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls  as we all know conservatives who support trump are racists who think their brand of christianity should be the law of the land so it is likely they will challenge every black and latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a muslim  and thats exactly what republican nominee donald trump wants  were going to watch pennsylvania trump declared during a rally in the state last month go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people dont come in and vote five times if you do that were not going to lose the only way we can lose in my opinion  i really mean this pennsylvania  is if cheating goes on  trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to stop crooked hillary from rigging this election  in response to trumps claim that the election will be rigged against him pennsylvania republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor originally it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage  with the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate pennsylvania is even more important now but voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in trumps favor and effect races down the ticket in short trump and the republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal and if it works in pennsylvania you can bet that republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else  featured image jeff swensengetty images

the fbi has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against hillary clintons use of a private email server the new evidence was discovered during an investigation into anthony weiner who was caught sexting with a 15year old girl and who is the estranged husband of clintons top aide huma abedin    apparently abedin and weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained tens of thousands of emails from abedin including emails she forwarded to herself from hillarys email account which were not turned into the fbi what this might mean is many of the deleted hillary emails were likely just recovered by the fbi if any of the emails are work related or classified that means both hillary and huma abedin lied to the fbi during their original investigation lying to the fbi is illegal and that alone is enough to prosecute hillary clinton and huma abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed this story is still developing but considering the fact the fbi released this letter just 11days before the election means they found something serious    on july 5th 2016 fbi director james comey laid out the evidence against hillary clintons use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her since then many high ranking officials within the fbi and other intelligence agencies have expressed dismay and disgust with director comeys decision meanwhile many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the fbi    a highranking fbi official told fox news that while it might not have been a unanimous decision it was unanimous that we all wanted her clintons security clearance yanked  it is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted the senior fbi official told fox news we were floored while listening to the fbi briefing because comey laid it all out and then said but we are doing nothing which made no sense to us  fox news  update october 17 2016  the fbi has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the fbi investigation into hillary clintons private email server the documents claim a state department official pressured the fbi into declassifying information in one of clintons emails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts both the fbi and state department deny the deal was ever struck    the fbi summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of state department officials that some called the shadow government who met weekly to discuss freedom of information requests related to hillary clinton as well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by hillary clinton and her staff as secretary of state there was even one incident where clinton ignored security advice that placed clinton her staff the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for her election campaign  bbc news    update october 25 2016  according to the the wall street journal a longtime clinton supporter donated nearly 500000 to an fbi officials wife who later investigated hillary clintons use of a private email server    uncovering the cover up reddit exposes paul combetta  in september of 2016 several reddit users exposed the identity of reddit user stonetear as paul combetta an it specialist who worked on hillary clintons private email server in fact mr combetta was granted immunity by the justice department for his involvement in the investigation even though paul combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33000 emails from clintons private email server    mr combetta posted a question on rexchangeserver asking the community how to strip the email address of a vip from a bunch of archived emails      it was assumed at the time that the vip being referenced in the post was hillary clinton however new evidence released today suggests the vip was in fact the president of the united states of america    wikileaks podesta emails release 7 october 14 2016  on march 4 2015 just hours after hillary clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the justice department john podesta the chairman of the hillary clinton

words those deleted 33000 emails we keep hearing about contain hillary clintons communications with president obama which means both hillary clinton and obama lied to the fbi justice department congress and the american people we now have definitive proof obama was communicating with hillary clinton on her private email server and knew she was using a private email server despite his claims otherwise    update october 25 2016 wikileaks podesta emails release 18 confirms intent of cover up  on march 7th president obama lied to the press and told the american people he found about hillary clintons private email server at the same time as the public cheryl mills an attorney for the clinton campaign then emails john podesta the same day a longtime clinton supporter donated nearly 500000

am jennifer palmieri jennifermpalmierigmailcommailtojennifermpalmierigmailcom wrote  they know potus and hrc emailed josh has been asked about that standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email so his answer to press was that he would not commentconfirm i recollect that josh was also asked if potus ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like potus likely had better things to do than focus on his cabinets email addresses  on mar 8 2015 at 1240 am philippe reines pirhrcofficecommailtopirhrcofficecom wrote  i find it odd the nyt didnt actually quote the president saying whats in their headline especially since the story has a disbelieving tone to his not noticing one of us should connect with the wh just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense im happy to do so to josh earnest since jen is in a weird position unless cheryl or john you want to or already have with someone else but its not unreasonable to assume that josh is going to get asked how this was possible and he should have the factset especially if its some weird technical thing with the presidents email setup that he doesnt see addresses  httpswwwwikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid21779  to make matters even worse for the cover up in another leaked email erika rottenberg another clinton attorney admits hillary clinton personally deleted many of the emails herself without oversight    i know when i talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and arent satisfied with answers to date while we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as oksecureappropriate to use a private server for secure documents and why further hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in it smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing ive either gotten discovery sanctions for fired people for etc  httpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid4099  the reason fbi director comey did not press charges against hillary clinton was due to a lack of intent he made the argument that hillary clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent and therefore did not commit a provable crime    however that was before the american people knew that hillary clinton was using a private insecure email server to communicate with president obama and before we had proof that hillary clinton deleted emails personally she also instructed paul combetta to remove evidence of the emails permanently and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the justice department this proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself and her boss president obama    this suggests the white house illegally subverted the fbi investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the presidents communications with her meanwhile by protecting hillary the white house was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up by securing the white house for another 4years it will prevent the american people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33000 emails    when you consider these facts as well as the other revelations within the podesta emails on wikileaks it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the clinton campaign and the white house in effect the white house is using the main stream media to elect clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy and hide the truth from the fbi congress and the american people    timeline of events  march 2 2015 the new york times breaks the story that clinton used a personal email account while secretary of state  march 4 2015 the benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all emails  march 7 2015 barack obama states he only learned about the private email server through news reports at the same time as everybody  march 7 2015 154116 0800 pst cheryl mills writes email id 31077 as revealed by podesta emails

obamas speech in new york shocks americans when he says this about attacks  i would say our president is useless but really this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance  he has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this this is just tone deaf to the nth power  im guessing that if youre reading this right now you keep up with the news or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events that being the case you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in new york and new jersey over the weekend as well as the stabbing that occurred in st cloud minnesota  while you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials you would be wrong  surely youd want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism especially on our own soil surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much if not because they actually mean it then for votes in the upcoming election   101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now  well apparently your president doesnt have any such feelings about the matter in fact not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in new york he ignored them in favor of speaking at a highdollar fundraiser  are you outraged yet  it gets better in lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred he lamented the sexism he says has been pushed by the likes of rush limbaugh and fox news who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet ive ever seen including msnbc claiming that they are the reason hillary clintons campaign is going down the tubes  he bashed trump while lauding hillary as some kind of savior while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terrorrelated  critics will say that he didnt have enough information to make an informed statement at the time but you dont have to know every single detail to say an explosion has taken place here in new york and i would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers and would ask you guys to do the same i will be making a more indepth statement later as i receive more details and then move on to the business of the hour  but no he couldnt even be bothered to do that disgusting

i woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed  bill clinton natural for foundation donors to seek favors  heres google  naturally my reaction was oh st what did bill clinton do to damage his wifes campaign now  of course the headline sounds really really awful it plays right into the idea that the clinton foundation is all about pay to play just like donald trump has been saying all along unfortunately it takes reading beyond the headlines which is something most people dont do to find out the real story  and the real story is that there is no pay to play  it was natural for people whove been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things and i trusted the state department wouldnt do anything they shouldnt do clinton told npr in an interview that aired monday morning source cnn  in other words people can ask for favors but that certainly doesnt mean theyll get them leaked emails have shown that some clinton foundation donors have gotten meetings with clinton and that others were turned down there is zero evidence of pay to play in other words people might have asked for favors but theres no evidence they got them  now lets talk about the foundation the media doesnt like to mention the trump foundation trump hasnt given to his own foundation since 2008 he does collect money from others though and gives it in his name he also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets all for himself but out of charity money  new york attorney general eric schneiderman said in a september 13 cnn interview that his office is investigating trumps charitable foundation over concerns that it engaged in some impropriety as related to new york charity laws the investigation launched amid reports from the washington post that trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself such as a 20000 oil painting of himself and a 12000 autographed football helmet and also recycled others contributions to make them appear to have come from him although he hasnt given to the foundation since 2008 source media matters  media matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote trump at the cost of clintons candidacy  journalists have been criticized for the double standard in the ways they cover trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton earlier this month cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to clintons pneumonia diagnosis as the washington posts reporting about the trump foundation this week both the trump foundation and trump organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of donald trumps dr oz stunt  all of this biased coverage is hurting clinton and helping trump trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks largely because the media covers every minor clinton scandal if you call getting sick a scandal while ignoring every scandal in trumps closet and trust me there are a lot  featured image via ethan millergetty images

cnbc reported that trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline trumps early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflictofinterest and we must impeach him for it  donald trumps business investments spread throughout the world now we know that he has ties to the dakota access pipeline the one that crosses sacred indian land  the construction of the pipeline raised the ire of native american sioux settlements in the area it will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply  the pipeline is also a threat to the missouri and mississippi rivers which provide drinking water for millions of people in addition the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country  opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests the protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them  the opposition brought out many supporters too on november 15 2016 there was a national day of action to protest the construction there were massive protests in cities as los angeles chicago denver and trumps own manhattan in support of the sioux nation  veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs american heroes supporting native american heroes  and now we learn that president trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines no wonder the orange fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president  this should come as no surprise since trump s financial ties are everywhere almost daily we hear of another financial conflictofinterest involving the president  this involvement is another example of trumps unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests the tenth amendment of the constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president and here it is another unconstitutional violation  according to ethics experts trumps decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate as with other presidents he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust  the blind trust would prohibit trump from any involvement as he wants it his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly and he would surely lie about it  the dakota pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by trump but perhaps the most controversial if only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of trumps support of the cruel actions of the police  we must insist that the media tell this story with its broadcast the public will see how trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment  please share this story on facebook

superman to not appear in justice league movie  when the new trailer for justice league appeared saturday most fans and even casual viewers alike noted the obvious lack of the iconic superman most felt that the justice league was not complete or even valid without henry cavills superman who as expected from his absence does not have a credit for this movie on imdb while clark kents love interest lois lane was featured in the trailer as portrayed by amy adams he will not actually appear himself at the end of dawn of justice if you watched the teaser dirt could be found floating above supermans grave indicating that he may actually be dead for good  with the scene being director zack snyders method of assuring fans he wont be returning   snyder doesnt regret killing the character off however he empathized with fans that thought that its hard to have a justice league without superman snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt not only did superman sacrifice himself he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future  that is something that has to be considered so while the team may respect that he gave his life they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him its an interesting dynamic snyder muses but i think audiences will be very interested

queen elizabeth and kate middleton clash again duchess scared of difficult pregnancy adopting second royal baby  reports  kate middleton is said to have miscarried however a new report claims otherwise the new report says that it is impossible for prince georges mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead in fact this is one of the things that kate and queen elizabeth are arguing heatedly about  the aug 11th print edition of life  style magazine claims that kate middleton and queen elizabeth are in a serious row this is not because kate middleton lost what could have been the baby sister reportedly of prince george but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all the assumption is that camilla parkerbowles prince charles wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of queen elizabeth but it seems as if kate middleton is rubbing the queen the wrong way too  celeb dirty laundry reports that kate middleton had it with all the meddling the queen is doing with her personal affairs especially on how to raise prince george and when she should get pregnant again even though she originally wanted a lot of kids having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby even though shes not entirely closing her doors to another baby kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet  allegedly she would rather adopt than have another one  because what the queen wants the queen should get kates attitude is making the queen see red  the idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the queen to a frenzy  royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal familys bloodline would be considered a spare for the throne so what kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off kate knows this but she also observes that the queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy she is hoping against hope that the queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home celeb dirty laundry reports  this is not the first time that kate middletons ways and ideas crossed the queen the life  style magazines july 14 feature tormented by the queen said the queen flew into rage when she learned of middletons plans to move baby prince george out of london  kate middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying prince george rather than plan another baby though for this summer the duke and duchess of cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of mystique with prince george now in tow august will be spent a bit differently  the couple will spend the rest of the time off in norfolk where the final refurbishments are being completed at their new country home anmer hall on the queens sandringham estate shared royal family sources with vanity fair

the biggest story this week was the arrest of pakistani muslim and longtime aide of debbie wasserman schultz imran awan earlier this year awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen shortly after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time in his attempt to avoid facing justice awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the dulles international airport this of course is scandalous to say the least and it was turned up another few notches after imran hired his lawyer the lawyer that was hired to defend imran was no other but a close clinton family associate and lawyer chris gowen  here is more from conservative review  in 2012 gowen went to bat for hillary clinton aide huma abedin whose family is deeply connected to the muslim brotherhood after gop reps explored abedins nefarious ties gowen pledged to stand with huma  along with his private practice the longtime clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at american university washington college of law where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management  gowens clinton connections are intriguing on another level given that awans employer in the house rep debbie wasserman schultz remains a close clinton confidant the former democratic national committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the democratic primary in clintons favor wasserman schultz was also the 2008 campaign cochair of hillary clintons first failed run for president  reading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story nonstop but that has not occurred at all in fact abc nbc and cbs have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal of course that seems ludicrous but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all however that has not stopped americans from pressing for more information and the heat is getting debbie wasserman schultz  now they are reports that debbie is not fairing well and has been an absolute wreck since imrans arrest also there are calls for debbie to testify before congress growing louder and it seems that she is about to cave  here is more from conservative fighters  debbie wasserman schultz employed pakistani it staffers and brothers who were paid over 4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cybersecurity breach  imran awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the us after wiring approximately 300000 to pakistan fox news is the only cable network covering this huge scandal when imran awan was arrested he was carrying 12000 in cash on him his wife was carrying 12000 of cash when she fled the country too  imran and his muslim brothers abid and jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as it specialists the three brothers were making 161000 165000 and 160000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background  word has it that debbie wasserman schultz is an absolute wreck since imran awan was arrested calls for her to testify to congress are increasingly growing as well  wasserman schultz knows shes in hot water over this it scandal the gateway pundit previously reported the fbi seized smashed hard drives belonging to imran awan we also reported that debbie wasserman schultz threatened the chief of the us capitol police with consequences for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a pakistani it staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches  it is rather clear in watching the video that debbie wasserman schultz has something to hide since why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the clintons  john cardillo reports florida politicos who have known wasserman schultz for years are telling me shes a nervous wreck barely able to function since imran awans arrest  fl politicos who have known dwstweets for years are telling me shes a nervous wreck barely able to function since imranawans arrest  john cardillo johncardillo july 27 2017  then someone witnessed wasserman schultz in the midst of an epic meltdown in public is it possible that wasserman schultz is realzing that the dnc is crumbling all around her now  meltdown from trusted source dwstweets seen screaming at teen daughter today in public over a 2 purse pictwittercomi7y0ri9c8s  jim hoft gatewaypundit july 28 2017  establishment media refuse to cover house it scandal rocking democrats httpstcolnwzhmkntf pictwittercomqoknosz3c8  the daily caller dailycaller july 27 2017  this is why alternative news is exploding over the traditional sources of media the mainstream media is refusing to cover this story but will report the fake russian collusion story and president trumps ban on transgenders in the military they will do anything they can to stop the real truth of what is happening in our government to be revealed  debbie wasserman schultz holds the key to many answers that the american people deserve to know hopefully by keeping the pressure on wasserman schultz she will crack and we can get to the bottom of the dnc corruption once and for all  share if you want the truth exposed

roger federer beats roberto agut as spectators cry foul in tennis news many are saying that aging athlete roger federer found it necessary to cheat at the miami open during his match with roberto batista agut a piercing womans scream distracted agut breaking his serve then on the next point a loud trumpet call was heard from the stands just as agut went to the net the videotape plainly demonstrates the interference but the match officials were evidently deaf as well as blind it is hard to believe that a beloved champion has come to this
775 shares facebook twitter  cnn news has claimed through polling that hillary clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate but others indicate otherwise snap polls show donald trump as the debate night winner talking points included the birther movement allegations the email controversy and trumps tax returns as well as other things  look at some of the snap polls below they include time magazine the drudge report cbs new york fox 5 and news 2 nashville among many others  donald trump took to twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate so far hillary clinton has yet to comment on it the cnn snap poll showed clinton at 62 percent and trump at 27 percent which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won thus something nefarious has to be going on with that cnn poll or the pool of people polled is off  521 people were polled by cnn but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more democrat which would explain the results despite clintons win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting so even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her  regardless of these apparent winning results as donald trump would say he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic that he should have brought up bill clintons infidelity even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate which is odd considering he apparently won  with the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds lets not forget that julian assange promised a few months back an october surprise release on wikileaks that would destroy hillary clintons campaign we all must wait and see

over the past several months the american public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the clinton foundation since hillary clinton was secretary of state  well a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought according to the daily caller the foundation aids program distributed watered down drugs to thirdworld countries  from the daily caller  former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative chai distributed watereddown hivaids drugs to patients in subsaharan africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation  the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative  the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clintons campaign  the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indianamericans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration fda and the securities and exchange commission the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundations vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watereddown drugs  this latest report proves that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching bill and hillary  do you think that the clinton foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world share your thoughts below

is ryan seacrest quitting live  ryan seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in new york city the talk show and radio host is renting a place in manhattan so that he can be in the big apple during the week in order to host live with kelly ripa each morning however a new report from radar online claims that seacrest  who had previously been living in los angeles  is miserable on the east coast  ryan is miserable moving was the biggest mistake of his life he hasnt embraced the city and hasnt been going out to the restaurants or parties hes invited to almost every event every night and doesnt go hes such an la guy and is finding nyc tough the weather and the hustle of the city is too much he cant wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved la a source told the popular gossip site  although radar online doesnt name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time this one has some people convinced it seems more than obvious that seacrest loved living in los angeles and he travels to the west coast so frequently that one could assume hes unhappy in new york he has been rooted in california for years and is used to a different way of life moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone let alone someone famous who has loved that la lifestyle for so long  this new report coincides with constant rumors that seacrest and his live cohost kelly ripa arent getting along although the two have been pals for many years sources have said that they are at each others throats and that their onair chemistry which some fans wouldnt argue doesnt even exist ends the moment the cameras stop rolling  as previously reported by the inquisitr ratings on live have dipped since the announcement that seacrest was the new cohost however that dip was almost to be expected given the hype built up around the announcement which had been building for a whole year however sources have said that seacrest wasnt ripas first choice  and maybe not even her second choice for fans of live seacrest wasnt even in their top five favorite contenders included andy cohen anderson cooper fred savage jerry oconnell and even kellys husband mark consuelos  so if any of these rumors are true will seacrest end up leaving live it is definitely a possibility however the gig hasnt seemed right for seacrest since his name was announced on monday may 1 some fans feel that he wasnt the best choice to be ripas cohost  and maybe thats going to turn out to be true  there are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that seacrest is going to leave live in 2018 it is entirely possible that he will want to move back to los angeles  and that he may ink a deal to host the new american idol that gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him  details of seacrests contract with live are unknown he may have signed a oneyear deal or he may have signed a multiyear deal however there are always ways for someone to get around something if they arent happy or its not working  do you think seacrest and ripa are good together do you think seacrest would prefer to move back to los angeles and leave morning talk in the past share your thoughts in the comments section below

this is a disaster in late december state senator doug ericksen proposed a new law that would give authorities the ability to charge protesters with economic terrorism and slap them with serious felony charges that could lead to jail time just for making their voices heard    the outrageous bill which has now had been formally introduced for consideration during the 2017 legislative session would make any form of protest that causes an economic disruption a class c felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison it wouldnt just apply to people who engage in illegal acts or vandalism it could be used to prosecute any person or group who organizes a protest that authorities deem as disruptive broadly interpreted this law could apply to time honored traditions of nonviolent dissent like boycotts and civil disobedience    weve already hit our initial goal of 50000 signatures on the petition but now that the bill has been introduced we need to get even more people speaking out if everyone reading this shares the video we can easily get 100000 signatures before we deliver it to the washington state lawmakers    charging protesters with terrorism clearly violates the first amendment and is an attempt to silence legitimate dissent please sign the petition telling lawmakers to reject this dangerous legislation  heres the text of the petition    organizing and participating in protests is a basic constitutional right guaranteed by the first amendment i urge all lawmakers to reject any legislation that criminalizes protesters or labels protests as a form of economic terrorism

when donald trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states it was at a time when europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism isis was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed  whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck the paris bombings or even the german priest that was beheaded for being a christianthey all were fueled by islam people need to understand that islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the united states  a georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional muslim veils  state rep jason spencer r filed legislation on wednesday that would prevent women from posing for drivers license photos while wearing a veil the measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving  spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about islamic terrorism spencers bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk  this bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of islamic terrorism and we in the state of georgia do not want our laws used against us spencer told wsbtv in atlanta  many people will immediately read this and argue that the first amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms and that is a true and correct argument our constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose  here is the problem islam is not a religion it is a cancerous disease that calls for all christians women and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god allah a vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of allah when was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the bible  quran 812 i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them  i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them quran 929 fight against those who believe not in allah nor in the last day nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth ie islam among the people of the scripture jews and christians until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued  fight against those who believe not in allah nor in the last day nor forbid that which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth ie islam among the people of the scripture jews and christians until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued quran 3151 soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority  is that what we want to blossom in our country schools and communities  just for starters liberals already banned school prayer because christian values may offend someoneso how is this any different  there is a difference between a hijab and burqa spencer is arguing that we should ban the fullon cover that cloaks women from head to toe  while liberals will decry this action they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the united states outside of georgia several other states are starting to propose similar legislation  the threat of islam and those that practice it are so severe that france and belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe local governments in italy spain and switzerland have also instituted bans

dancing with the stars donald trump asked to star in show  he hasnt said no  what the heck donald trump seems pretty busy on the campaign trail but hes been invited to take some time off to try his hand or feet at dancing apparently dancing with the stars has asked donald to join the season 23 cast  they really want someone political on the show especially this season being so close to the election a source told hollywoodlifecom exclusively they have always wanted bill clinton and will obviously never get him but they always ask and they asked donald trump to see if he would be interested to do the show even while running for president  but why is donald such a hot ticket for the show they would have loved this season to grab him for many reasons especially coming off of a season with his ex marla maples being on the show the insider explained but they havent got a response and always expected a no in the producers eyes it was worth asking well he hasnt said no yet so there may still be a glimmer of hope  if there were concerns about no one wanting to dance with ryan lochte because of fan backlash we cant imagine how hard it would be for donald to find a willing partner the republican nominee comes up with a new hateful message each week getting democrats angrier and angrier at him however on aug 24 he seemed to be softening his immigration stance on hannity so maybe he would do this to become more likable well just have to see when the full cast list comes out  hollywoodlifers do you think donald trump should do dwts share your thoughts with us

for decades employers have been holding america hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we dont vote the way they want of course what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway jobs get outsourced wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced  it hasnt been since well the last presidential election though that weve seen a ceo be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side republican loses four years ago it was papa john schnatter who threatened to cut his employees hours and raise the price of pizzas if obamacare went through it did and he didnt  this year another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesnt get his way andy puzder is the ceo of carls jr and hardees heres one of his commercials which may not be safe for work  judging by the commercials like donald trump puzder likely cares little about political correctness but thats not the reason he wants a republican in office he just doesnt want to pay people more or at all in an oped in the wall street journal puzder says that if a democrat wins either democrat he will fully automate his stores speaking about an automated fast food system named eatsa puzder wrote  i want to try it ceo andy puzder told business insider of his automated restaurant plans we could have a restaurant thats focused on allnatural products and is much like an eatsa where you order on a kiosk you pay with a credit or debit card your order pops up and you never see a person with government driving up the cost of labor its driving down the number of jobs he says youre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores but in restaurants this is the problem with bernie sanders and hillary clinton and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage says puzder does it really help if sally makes 3 more an hour if suzie has no job source yahoo finance  this threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees across the country puzder has about 20000 employees hes hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests  puzder also has his own blog where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism one has to wonder if his 20000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is  puzder is doing just fine in 2012 it was reported that he made nearly 45 million his profits have been up in recent years but his employees dont see any of that in fact puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied  you can guarantee though that even if a republican wins the white house and the minimum wage stays the same puzder will still be automating thats just the way he is profits over people

16k shares facebook twitter  muslim somali asylum seeker abdullah in sundsvall sweden is a bastard abdullah is wellknown by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes assaults and molestations this aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to sweden 5 years ago his most recent crime wasnt to any stranger this time it was to his wife  he had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money before he left he commanded not suggested his wife that her niece she was babysitting must be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it  the story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his muslim right to punish his pregnant wife for her disobedience comes into play he forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach he then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her that is strange to me since muslims arent supposedly suppose to have alcohol i wonder why it was there in the first place he then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine  thank you mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a disobedient woman especially when pregnant  quran 434  so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in the husbands absence what allah would have them guard but those wives from whom you fear arrogance  first advise them then if they persist forsake them in bed and finally strike them but if they obey you once more seek no means against them indeed allah is ever exalted and grand  just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of beat them the islamic prophet muhammad modeled it literally telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest  i wonder where it says you can pick and choose which edicts from the quran and hadith you want to obey this guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists i believe the quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but i guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times or someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for muslims which he is following

surprise 70 of charlotte rioters are not from there  guess what that means video  imagine that at least 70 of the rioters in charlotte north carolina were bused in they had out of state ids looks like it was well planned i know here in tulsa hubby had to leave work early yesterday we got word that black lives matter was busing people into tulsa as well in our case things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately they werent so lucky in charlotte the head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in  this is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning wait for something to happen that causes outrage use the black community as useful tools for your agenda bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on the people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets charlotte was a wild success for them tulsa not so much  from louder with crowder  wait the bulk of the people rioting in north carolina are coming from out of state shut up generally speaking when theres a riot like this its all from people who are from the community care about their community and know what theyre even rioting about in the first place no no thats not sarcasm shut up  101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now take it away cnn this is not charlotte thats out here these are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems these are not protestors these are criminals weve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside they were coming in on buses from out of state if you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night i can about say probably 70 of those had outofstate ids theyre not coming from charlotte  i think the reason it did not work here in tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to black lives matter also the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with manslaughter i still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat charlotte has a large black lives matter contingent and since there have been other events there it was primed already for a riot its not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda  these people dont care about the facts or that black people are dying they are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos thats their goal its part of wanting to burn all of america down its what communists do  they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now

after collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 911 ceremony in new york city hillary clinton emerged from her daughters apartment seeming like a new person too new to be believed as a matter of fact since the hillary at chelsea clintons apartment was noticeably well and energetic even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter more vibrant and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment the nose on the hillary clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of hillary in the past  the different nose is a dead giveaway in the identification of nose types the real hillary clinton has what is known as the nordic nose which is quite common and straight the clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge this being more of a roman type  aside from the different nose types the clone hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent hillarys stand in also has no mole above her right lip hillary clinton does  since the real hillary clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election aside from those bill clinton will do himself  the question we must ultimately ask ourselves is will hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with donald trump that are coming up or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates  what we need to look for immediately is her appearance if she appears to be much thinner younger or without a cough and hoarseness we should know this is not the real hillary clinton if she appears to be right on the mark without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness this is the clone not hillary clinton  the biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is will the real hillary clinton ever be seen or heard as president of the united states or will her double conduct all public appearances meetings with foreign dignitaries state of the union addresses and speeches it could be possible that if she wins the election it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect including the swearing in  it is a very big possibility that the real hillary clinton may not even play a part of a new clinton administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity  if anyone thought president obama may not be who he claims he is such a clinton administration being conducted entirely without hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about obama seem inconsequential  the american people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in barack h obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed to accept an idea as president hillary clinton may be the first administration in us history where she is only a figurehead or an idea but not in charge of anything  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

posted by frank wilkenmeyer on 19 sep 2016  weve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong one of the most famous is probably read my lipsno new taxes a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after george hw bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases what donald trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in chelsea and minnesota may have that beat  jasonmillerindc statement on last weekends terror attacks httpstcodzlivkchmb pictwittercoml3evtvlcfo  official team trump teamtrump september 19 2016  take a look at that and consider what it says the personal attacks on president obama and secretary clinton aside trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in america he didnt promise to increase funding to counterterrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil  lets imagine for a moment that trump actually tried to implement this plan of his destroy doesnt leave much to the imagination while the mouthbreathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty yeeeeehaw the reality is that hes talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in america hes talking about profiling muslims hes talking about donald trumps version of the patriot act where nobody with brown skin is safethe man being hunted by the fbi for example isnt just a muslim hes an  the man being hunted by the fbi for example isnt just a muslim hes an american citizen with the right to due process just because hes a suspect in a bombing doesnt mean hes guilty of setting off bombs with this blanket trump statement however this man would be in a deck of cards marked kill and not on the most wanted list theres nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship constitutional rights or due process would come into play  what that means is that under trumps dream regime we could expect muslim heavy neighborhoods like dearborn and queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return without a way to differentiate christian arabs from muslims would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot if you think im being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an american presidential candidate is leaning read that statement one more time it isnt about the narrative it isnt about prevention or education  its about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs it may sound good to a bunch of knuckledraggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means donald trump just became even more frightening  the only solace we have is that what hes promising is nothing but another read my lips terrorism isnt something you can simply destroy just because you said so the thought of turning our streets into a denzel washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isnt going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism like the rest of donald trumps campaign in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weakminded gullible morons  featured image from file
exclusive pics first photos of ariana grande since manchester attack  an emotional ariana grande was spotted for the first time since the terror attack at her manchester concert on monday as she touched down in her hometown of boca raton florida  the pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend mac miller who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the 23yearold singer  ariana who was dressed in headtotoe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with miller before being whisked away in an suv caravan to a family members home in a nearby gated community  miller could also been seen warmly embracing arianas mother joan who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles  police cars were also seen surrounding joans nearby home less than 24 hours after 22 people lost their lives and another 119 were injured when a improvised device went off inside manchester arena just moments after ariana performed her final song  joan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos  rather than panic however she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem  ariana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack but did post a message on twitter early tuesday writing broken from the bottom of my heart i am so so sorry i dont have words  the pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her muchanticipated european tour which kicked off in stockholm on may 8 and was set to wrap up on june 15 in rome  she and joan made a quick and quiet departure from england early tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star taylor swift who lent the two women one of her private jets sources told tmz however that swift wasnt involved in the process as the private jet was financed down the middle by grandes touring corporation live nation and manager scooter braun  isis is now taking credit for the monday night massacre with authorities identifying 22yearold salman abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage  the blast from abedis improvised devise went off just seconds after ariana finished her final song of the evening with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts  abedi is the britishborn son of libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where ariana performed on monday  police are still investigating whether or not abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack  that individual who is 23 has not yet been identified by police  investigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on monday by arianas young fans and the arenas surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out  prime minister theresa may announced tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical meaning an attack could happen imminently in britain  if the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 london commuters on three subway trains and a bus in july 2005  manchester arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended  one witness said grande had just finished her final song and said thank you manchester before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion  the incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another  taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down  city officials said the true spirit of manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident  while twitter and facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for  the names of the victims are also slowly becoming public revealing that most were young female teenagers no doubt thrilled to be seeing ariana perform live for the first time  eightyearold saffie rose roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time even more tragic is the fact that the young girls mother lisa still has no idea as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life  saffies older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack  georgina callander 18 lost her life as well in the attack just hours after the teenager tweeted at ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert  two years prior georgina had got to go backstage and meet grande after her performance and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star  saffie and georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of tarleton and on tuesday their friends family neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls whose lives were cut tragically short  some carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read i love mcr  with the whole of britain in mourning over this tragedy both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming june 6 election our of respect for the victims  a number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of monday nights attack  david beckham who became a global sports superstar while playing for manchester united posted on facebook heartbreaking news from manchester as a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me my thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy  his spice girlturned designer wife victoria who lived in manchester after marrying beckham added my heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in manchester last night  swift who later offered up her private jet to ariana wrote my thoughts prayers and tears for all those affected by the manchester tragedy tonight im sending all my love  katy perry also commented on the violent attack saying praying for everyone at arianagrandes show broken hearted for the families tonight broken hearted for ari broken hearted for the state of this world  and rihanna wrote manchester has always been so close to my heart these are innocent vulnerable kids this couldve been any of us im devastated  praying for the beautiful souls we lost their families and loved ones for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this manchester  one of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from britishborn talk show host james corden who was taping his late night program in los angeles when the attack occurred on monday  it shocks me every time we hear this sort of news that attacks like this can happen but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight  many of you wont have ever been to manchester but you will definitely have heard of it its famous all over the world for so many wonderful things great football teams man city man united its famous for incredible music oasis and joy division  it was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes its the home of the inventor of the first computer its a place full of comedy and curries and character  but when i think of manchester the place that i know i think of the spirit of the people there and im telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find  strong proud caring people with community at its core and if it was even possible the spirit of the people of manchester will grow even stronger this evening  my thoughts and prayers are with everyone in manchester tonight all of the staff of the men arena all of the security teams all of the emergency services ariana and her team and all of those families affected by tonight well all go to bed holding our little ones even tighter this evening

obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the un assembly during it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating isis and other islamic extremist groups in syria and otherwise he spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his jv team  seeing as the us is the global police force he said that we have no chance of winning this battle  the daily caller reports that obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the islamic state group he cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution  if we are honest we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long said obama  president obama continued by saying that we must be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy  he mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the islamic state group he also categorized syria as a place like syria where theres no ultimate military victory to be won  instead obama suggested that we pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect  which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most reasonable people to try to deal with  its likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical islam and death and violence these are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected muslim terrorist  its this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some jv team gets us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse  its about time we start calling it like it is and taking action were past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyones feelings if we dont take action soon then obamas pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality  make sure to share this on facebook if you think its time we take action against the very real threat that is radical islam  source conservative tribune

billy bushs wife is furious at him after trump interview leak  billy bush may have just posted a new selfie with his wife but rumors are swirling that all is not well back in their california paradise  the recentlyfired today show host has moved back to los angeles after his nowinfamous 2005 access hollywood interview with donald trump was leaked  but sources told page six that sydney davis bushs wife of 18 years is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters  she was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while an nbc insider told the site they are having marriage problems  in the tape bush can be heard calling actress arianne zucker hot as s and also saying nothing while trump makes lewd comments about his cohost nancy odell  but the moment that really angered davis a source claims was when bush after gawking at zuckers legs asked her if she would give him and the donald a little hug  it wasnt just the vile talk the source said its because he insisted the woman hug him and trump it was creepy  bush 45 later released an apology for the interview and said he was embarrassed and ashamed but did not make any mention of davis  i was younger less mature and acted foolishly in playing along he said in the statement im very sorry  the source said davis is enraged that bush was stupid enough to put himself in that position and has now lost what could have been a lifechanging gig  billy has brought him on himself they said hes blown his big chance at today and he doesnt have his old job at access hollywood to fall back on  he fears his career is over his wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters  bush refused to comment on the article to page six telling the site i cannot take this call  davis has also never released a statement about the incident but on saturday she did reappear on her husbands instagram  bush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving the today show posting a picture of him and davis in the great outdoors  hiking with lady long legs he wrote in the caption nice to get out  it was the first photo bush 45 had shared on instagram in three weeks  davis features prominently in bushs instagram most recently visiting him in new york with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal  teaching the squad about the nyc subway only way to go bush wrote in one caption adding that his daughters hated when he said the word squad  in another photo him and davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo  bush who worked at access hollywood for 15 years had only held his new job at today for two months when he was given the boot following the trump scandal  matt lauer confirmed bushs contract had been terminated effective immediately on an episode of the today show last week  lauer closed out by saying all of us here at today wish billy the very best  tamron hall also acknowledged bushs departure later in the show saying as a longtime member of the nbc family we wish billy all the best as he moves forward  bush said in a statement following the announcement that he was deeply grateful for the conversations hed had with his three teenage daughters  i look forward to what lies ahead he added  although speculation has swirled regarding where bush might go next  including to the rumored future trump tv  he has not yet confirmed his next step  instead it seems bush has been busy trying to return to life in los angeles even putting up his luxury manhattan townhouse on the market for 82million  bush had purchased the building for 88million just last december  it was initially reported that bush walked away from nbc with 10million but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate  instead it is believed nbc would only pay some of the remainder of bushs 3millionayear contract according to cnn money  exact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a noncompete clause meaning bush can look for jobs at rivals stations  bushs attorney marshall grossman spoke with the hollywood reporter about the interview with trump saying that bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at trumps statements and made lewd comments of his own  if billy had been passive or responded shut the f up to trump billy would have been out of a job the next day said grossman  but one source told the daily mail online that bush had bragged about the tape while covering the olympics this summer in rio  what is stunning is how selfimportant billy is the source said  many people believe access hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting billy while not doing the right thing and informing nbc news

i cant wait for weekend at chelseas to hit the big screen cnn and the rest of hillary clintons slobbering media sycophants have already written the script if this woman god forbid dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow these doting suckups  these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has understandably reached an alltime low  would dutifully parrot the clinton campaign talking points and call it a minor setback to her inevitable victory  the american people arent buying it this is a severely ill woman no more conspiracy theory dismissals mrs clintons mild cold er seasonal allergies i mean heat exhaustion that is to say minor case of pneumonia is evidently of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a mystery man who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable episodes or otherwise freezes up with a brain shortcircuit during a speech  this guy has been spotted with the clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when hillary suffered a brain blood clot also covered up and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a diazepam pen diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures  blue tinted glasses of the sort mrs clinton was wearing sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures these therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of parkinsons disease  a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate mrs clinton likely suffers since when has pneumonia required a neurological squeeze test  the clinton campaign needs to come clean they wont but they should i wonder what official diagnosis well get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm secret service agents acting as though theyve been there a hundred times before nothing to see here folks secretary clintons sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she powered through yesterday going doortodoor  the point is that once more by lying about illness mrs clinton has reinforced and justified concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president shes proven yet again that she cant be trusted she has confirmed a number of preconceptions that voters as revealed by her historically low approval ratings have formed relative to her health and character shes a liar thats her default mode shes corrupt and shes sick very sick she puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else  including the best interests of the nation and even her own life  do i take joy in mrs clintons sufferings and plummeting poll numbers well no on the first yes on the second do not gloat when your enemy falls when they stumble do not let your heart rejoice proverbs 2417  indeed mrs clinton has had a very bad week but her poll numbers were already trending downward her medical crisis over the weekend coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of donald trumps supporters as a racist and irredeemable basket of deplorables has only served to accelerate the plunge  perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement  especially by this particular woman this is the same hillary clinton who once called the late sen robert byrd dwva her friend and mentor sen byrd of course was a recruiter for the actually deplorable kkk this is the same hillary clinton whose husband former president bill clinton was caught jokingin 2008 that president obama should be carrying his bags  the same woman whose democratic party opposed the 1964 civil rights act while republicans not unlike those she just slandered worked hard to pass it finally and going back a bit further this is the same hillary clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the us while hundredsofthousands of republicans gave up their lives to free them  whos the racist  im praying for hillary clinton despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie our eyes have been telling us the truth for months maybe even years now to watch this increasingly frail bitter and elderly woman stiffen up convulse and collapse into the arms of wellpracticed staffers is hard to stomach you cant help but feel some modicum of compassion for her wicked though she may be  its almost tragic to witness hillary clinton has lived her entire life for this moment everything shes ever done or said and the mounding piles of lecherous bs shes put up with from her sexually predatory partnerincrime has been designed to place her in the oval office not as first lady but as president of the united states proverbs 1921 says many are the plans in a persons heart but it is the lords purpose that prevails  am i saying theres no chance hillary clinton will win not at all though i think it unlikely between her devoted media harpies her team of aroundtheclock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and coverup theres always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory  still it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for hillary clintons political aspirations even so i also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector  a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee  when they visit her in prison  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

elon musk the brains behind tesla spacex and paypal has decided to go into early retirement and abandon all current projects his most recent project named neuralink was met with much dissapointment from the medical community when musk announced plans which aimed to improve memory or even create artificial intelligence doctors around the world criticized his ideas and suggested that he should look into more humanitarian projects instead of trying to advice science musk has yet to make a public comment on his retirement but it likely has to do with the failure of neuralink to excite the science community in the ways tesla and spacex have
seth rich seth rich   editors note 51717 we want to update you on a story you first saw on fox 5 dc we want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by rod wheeler the private investigator hired by seth richs family whose services are being paid for by a third party  what he told fox 5 dc on camera monday regarding seth richs murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours rod wheeler has since backtracked  in an interview monday wheeler told fox 5 dc he had sources at the fbi confirming there was evidence of communication between seth rich and wikileaks this is the verbatim of that exchange  fox 5 dc you have sources at the fbi saying that there is information  wheeler for sure  fox 5 dc that could link seth rich to wikileaks  wheeler absolutely yeah thats confirmed  in the past 48 hours rod wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from fbi sources contradicting what he told us on monday  since rod wheeler backtracked tuesday fox 5 dc attempted incessantly to communicate with him but he didnt return calls or emails  on wednesday just before our newscast wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation where he now backtracks his position and wheeler characterizes his ontherecord and oncamera statements as miscommunication  when asked if wheeler is still working for seth richs family wheeler told fox 5 dc the contract still stands ties have not been severed  we reached out once again to the rich family and through a spokesperson the rich family tells fox 5 dc the family has relayed their deep disappointment with rod wheelers conduct over the last 48 hours and is exploring legal avenues to the family    original story  it has been almost a year since democratic national committee staffer seth rich was murdered in the nations capital there have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now  rich was shot and killed last july in northwest dc and police have suggested the killing in the districts bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery however online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to richs work at the dnc  just two months shy of the oneyear anniversary of richs death fox 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right  rod wheeler a private investigator hired by the rich family suggests there is tangible evidence on richs laptop that confirms he was communicating with wikileaks prior to his death wheelers services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party according to a statement issued by the rich family tuesday which also includes that the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by a third party and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family  now questions have been raised on why dc police the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that  wheeler a former dc police homicide detective is running a parallel investigation into richs murder he said he believes there is a coverup and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation  the police department nor the fbi have been forthcoming said wheeler they havent been cooperating at all i believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer which i believe is either at the police department or either at the fbi i have been told both  when we asked wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links rich to wikileaks he said absolutely yeah thats confirmed  wheeler also told us i have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said rod we were told to stand down on this case and i cant share any information with you now that is highly unusual for a murder investigation especially from a police department again i dont think it comes from the chiefs office but i do believe there is a correlation between the mayors office and the dnc and that is the information that will come out tuesday  wheeler told fox 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details  fox 5s melanie alnwick spoke with dc police on tuesday and was told that wheelers assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the rich case was false  the family sent alnwick a statement on tuesday with the following statement  as weve seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims we see no facts we have seen no evidence we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press even if tomorrow an email was found it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and weve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so we are a family who is committed to facts not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seths murderers the services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the rich family and paid for by a third party and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family  previous coverage on the seth rich murder investigation  family of dnc staffer seth

victim if they were muslim before stabbing the person    the attacker has now been identified as somali immigrant dahir adan a muslim    dahir adan  dahir adan  st cloud somaliamerican community

student in high school but of course      jason falconer  officer jason falconer of the avon minnesota police department  st cloud mayor dave kleis reported to the media that adan was shot and killed by offduty police officer jason falconer kleis called falconer a hero who happened to be in the right place at the right time    falconer approached adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law thats when adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him  officer falconer then proceeded to send adan to allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs    last year the washington times reported that obamas administration had relocated almost 10thousand somali refugees to minnesota    the times went on to say that somalis are targeted by terror groups such as isis for recruitment and that one organization warned of attacks on american malls    this population is also being targeted by islamist terror

said    in june three somalians living in minnesota were convicted of trying to join isis    in july the somali terror group alshabab was approached by isis officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack america    department of homeland security documents show that while hillary clinton served as secretary of state over 31000 somali refugees were relocated to the united states    us issued

that under a clinton administration the total number of muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone    its clear that muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by isis and other terror groups its clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in minnesota    men  women minding their own business had their faces slashed open and were stabbed repeatedly by a single isis convert and hillary clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum    hillary cannot be allowed to become president under her rule terror attacks on us citizens will increase exponentially all because she and the dnc want to pander to islamists in the hope that they will vote democratic and that their party will continue to rule    a vote for hillary is a vote for isis and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing american men women and children    dont vote for isis hillary

back when the news first broke about the paytoplay corruption involving thensecretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation  where donors to the foundation were granted political access including lavish white house state dinners  the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed good that the foundation has done over the years  i dont think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than a moneymaking machine for the clinton family and their wellconnected friends the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity so they had to divert some of their resources to causes that way they could always point to those grants as evidence that theyre an organization for good  the daily caller reported that only 57 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity  just 57 percent of the clinton foundations massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants according to the taxexempt organizations irs filings the rest went to salaries and employee benefits fundraising and other expenses the clinton foundation spent a hair under 913 million in 2014 the organizations irs filings show but less than 52 million of that went to charitable grants that number pales in comparison to the 348 million the foundation spent on salaries compensation and employee benefits another 504 million was marked as other expenses while the remaining almost 851k was marked as professional fundraising expenses despite taking in an additional 30 million in 2014 the clinton foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 even as it slashed charitable spending the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries employee benefits and compensation by 5 million in 2014 the foundation also spent 5 million more other expenses in 2014  sometimes things are exactly as they appear this was nothing more than a way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

maxine waters dca is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant she is always angry something that she wears as a badge of honor she has pushed the lie about president trump having russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the white house for  now the demented democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that over her 35 years in congress maxine waters has missed 90 of congressional meetings  known in some circles as the poverty pimp waters has been peddling race baiting socialist agendas and a hatred for president that borders is obsessive she has accomplished very little in her career  even today she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy to say the least  on top of that she seems to imply that as a woman of color she can not be thrown out of office  while the word color may have been been congress since she mumbles more than speaks it is clear that race over substance matters is the waters credo  then again when one attends only 10 of the meetings that are expected of them there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about she has not real record to run on only that she is a minority  thankfully even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service  still america was well aware that waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp we just never knew how little time she spent there  come to think of it considering her views it may in fact be better if she spent even less time there  sources teddy stick  1tch

back when the news first broke about the paytoplay corruption involving thensecretary of state hillary clinton and the clinton foundation  where donors to the foundation were granted political access including lavish white house state dinners  the clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed good that the foundation has done over the years  i dont think anyone was fooled into thinking that the clinton foundation was anything other than a moneymaking machine for the clinton family and their wellconnected friends the foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity so they had to divert some of their resources to causes that way they could always point to those grants as evidence that theyre an organization for good  the daily caller reported that only 57 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity  just 57 percent of the clinton foundations massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants according to the taxexempt organizations irs filings the rest went to salaries and employee benefits fundraising and other expenses the clinton foundation spent a hair under 913 million in 2014 the organizations irs filings show but less than 52 million of that went to charitable grants that number pales in comparison to the 348 million the foundation spent on salaries compensation and employee benefits another 504 million was marked as other expenses while the remaining almost 851k was marked as professional fundraising expenses despite taking in an additional 30 million in 2014 the clinton foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 even as it slashed charitable spending the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries employee benefits and compensation by 5 million in 2014 the foundation also spent 5 million more other expenses in 2014  sometimes things are exactly as they appear this was nothing more than a way for the clintons to make massive amounts of money and hillary used her position as secretary of state to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom
has tom hiddlestons embarrassing romance with taylor swift cost him a job  yikes tom hiddleston and taylor swifts romance showmance really isnt having the effect that their pr teams had hoped for with tom reportedly losing a huge contract due to the embarrassing display  last month it was reported that fashion giant armani was considering using tom as its new face replacing taylors ex calvin harris interesting  however it seems the italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to hiddlestons recent publicityhungry antics with his new girlfriend  executives apparently fear that they will be seen as cashing in on the drama something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from  a source shared tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from calvin  obviously with tom now being taylors other half and the calvin past deal it would generate huge media coverage and headlines  but armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better armani would hate to be seen as getting pr for their brand by riding on taylor swifts coattails so tom will not get the job  the insider continued while tom is without doubt one of the sexiest actors of his generation he may not be the right fit this time  the brand is looking at attracting 30somethings and under so tom may be a little too old ouch  tom hit the headlines when he was conveniently photographed embracing taylor on an isolated beach less than three weeks after she had split from her longterm boyfriend calvin  the pair has embarked on a eyebrowraising display of love across the globe with taylor even meeting toms mother in front of the waiting photographers after just nine days of dating  tom was relentlessly mocked after donning an i heart taylor swift tank top during fourth of july celebrations and wondered if that might have a negative impact on his career while others wondered if it was just a joke  if armani is indeed shying away from the star that negative impact might be painfully real

136k shares share this story  hillary clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonights debate by the mainstream media but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise the trumpwon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top trend in the united states  the 1 trend on twitter right now is trumpwon  thank you  donald j trump realdonaldtrump september 27 2016  whats curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from  which will come as quite a surprise  data is from trendsmapcom  thats right the trumpwon hashtag originated in st petersberg russia where dictator vladimir putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cybertrolls and bloggers who work overtime to advance putins agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya its a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten moscow putins trolls have already been caught flooding american social media circles with protrump and proputin propaganda as the russian statecontrolled media promotes trump to their european audiences  putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of trump who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against russian oligarchs by the obama administration after the russian annexation of crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further russian aggression in eastern europe  the guardian reached out to some exbloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop humourless and draconian with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people each controlled by three editors who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted or were ideologically deviant  so remember  dont trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section it might be a russian blogger making 800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

if this is true it will mean an opening for another conservative justice to be appointed by president trump    she said she will resign if trump was elected president and now when he got elected and with a month until the inauguration she will be resigning    the supreme court is in recess for the summer but justice ruth bader ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in november asked on thursday about the prospect of donald trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices she seemed uneasy at the thought    i dont want to think about that possibility but if it should be then everything is up for grabs she told the associated press in a wideranging interview that also touched on the loss of her dear friend antonin scalia and some of the courts biggest rulings in the term that ended in late june    i really dislike that man for a number of reasons and although i am not supposed to put forth my personal views because of my position i still feel obligated to do whatever i can in order to let the public know that theres still time to make the right choice she added    donald trump is a man who has accumulated his vast wealth not because of his business prowess but because of the fact that much of it was inherited from his father and grandfather in fact when it comes to making important decisions i dont recall him ever making the right one and thats not the type of man that should be at the head of this country    after opening fire at the presumptive republican presidential candidate ginsberg turned to her ownwi plans should donald trump actually become the new president of the united states    theres no need to beat around the bush so im just going to go ahead and say it  i will resign my position as a justice of the supreme court of the united states if that happens i cannot imagine performing my duties under the constant pressure of waking up in the morning and having to go to work knowing that every ruling we as an institution make will be viewed through the prism of a trump presidency i can tolerate this charade of a presidential campaign but i could not live with him as president she said    i am a woman who has lived long enough and i am proud to say ive had a prosperous and fulfilled life justice ginsberg argued    however i am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket i fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the constitution of the united states i see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when im aware that everything i say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires gps just to find his belly button while taking a shower

the republican war on women continues unabated the same week that conservatives argued in the supreme court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan indiana joined the ranks of states like texas and florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women while in fact endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get and gov mike pence recently signed it the bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible and ideally something women cant get legally at all  asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms pence argued in an interview with the huffington post that abortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented so lets get that straight right away  i oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because i believe that killing someone or something if you will that hasnt developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime and if were murderers of innocent beings who cant defend themselves how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other the indiana governor said  and as if that wasnt enough pence continued weve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness and others just flat out prohibit it and thats bad for a number of reasons first and foremost  we cant have this kind of freedom of choice this is bad lets be clear and thats part of the reason why i signed this bill because i believe abortion or im going to flat out call it murder this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state so indiana is just a step in the right direction  pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion first and foremost because this is such a sensitive topic let me just say that i sympathize with rape victims not just in america but around the world i can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma he said however that does not justify murder not even that justifies murdering a baby not in my book because what would happen wed then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion and that has to be stopped at all cost  donald trumps new running mate also said basically if id have said no on the bill that would be just like giving out getpregnantwithoutfear cards because at the end of the day women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what theyd do in the event of pregnancy and you know its not supposed to be like that that would be equal to me picking up a butchers knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street that would be murder and im not a murderer  and it gets worse  when you get an abortion you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover and there are a lot of crazy people out there what if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work i mean indianas economy is struggling as it is and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state im telling you i made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run pence concluded

thanks in part to the declassification of defense intelligence documents connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most middle east observers have suspected all along that the rise of the terrorist group isis and the likelihood of establishing a terror state a caliphate had been predicated by both the cia and dia as far back as 2012  and purposely created by the obama administration in part to isolate the syrian government of president bashar alassad the documents also predicted that the support given by the west turkey and the persian gulf arab states to the takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a salafist principality in eastern syria  according to investigative reporter nafeez ahmed the leaked document reveals that in coordination with the gulf states and turkey the west intentionally sponsored violent islamist groups to destabilize assad despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an islamic state in iraq and syria  obviously obamas dismissal of isis being nothing more than a jv team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in iraq seems to be as the documents indicate considerably more sinister than first assumed in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most middle eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error  however the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside libya before the 2012 terror attack in benghazi  and the report leaves no doubt that us intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from benghazi to syrian ports  however what isnt in dispute is that american servicemen and woman and those in benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine middle eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our national security  here is a link to the judicial watch press release detailing the released documents  here are the released documents themselves

recently republican ohio gov john kasich vetoed the socalled heartbeat bill a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy or before many women even know that they are pregnant at the same time kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions only for saving a pregnant womans life or preventing the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function  at the risk of sounding discriminatory which is not at all my goal here but at the risk of sounding like that there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions kasich told the ohio daily star women are wonderful beings they are kind loving incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them but at the end of the day im sorry to have to say this but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things the women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex or to get their partners to marry them  he continued our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have today the situation is so critical that i honestly fear for the future of this country and so i was in a position to make a change and do something important and so i did and theres one very simple reason why i did it thats that if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when theyre supposed to be closed if she doesnt have the foresight to make sure she doesnt get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion  a woman like that can barely take care of herself and were supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child  a being whos done no wrong and only exists as its mothers mistake do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations to literally force them to commit manslaughter kasich said i dont know about the rest of the people living in my state but i for one am not comfortable with that one bit and so i reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening  and ill tell you another thing  as of recently all cases of outofwedlock pregnancies in the state of ohio will have to be approved by the state that means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isnt married or at the very least engaged will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental and in the case of the latter the couple will be fined a total of 100000 with 70000 of the fine being charged on the mothertobe for not being able to not only use birth control but having sex before marriage in the first place women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open the governor concluded  sourcenewslocom

the us government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm the company was vulnerable to us prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the us market  ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce  the department of justice further levied a 500 million fine and forfeiture on the company  this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company said us attorney for the district of maryland rod j rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty  when companies sell adulterated drugs they undermine the integrity of the fdas approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard ineffective or unsafe said stuart f delery acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the department of justice when the government announced its action against the indian company  the department of justice stated in its final settlement alleged due to the companys diluted drugs it subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality according to the report  the question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was a false promise asked blackburn in an interview with thedcnf  the possibility that chai distributed adulterated and diluted aids drugs to third world victims could shake the foundations of the clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate hillary clintons campaign  blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the department of health and human services and to the department of state where hillary served as secretary of state during president barack obamas first term  the congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between bill and two controversial indianamericans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the food and drug administration fda and the securities and exchange commission  the most troubling revelations concern the clinton foundations vigorous promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda  it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watereddown drugs  propublica estimated that in 2007 alone the us agency for international development allocated 9 million to ranbaxy and delivered more than 18 million packages  substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from hivrelated infections roger bate an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told thedcnf  thakur told thedcnf that many of the companys antiretroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in aids patients  these drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients if the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label you will not see the platelet levels or the wbc levels stabilize he said  ranbaxys first public hint of problems occurred in august 2004 one year after chai began working with the firm the world health organization reported irregularities involving three ranbaxy drugs in south africa according to the report  the fda sent a public warning letter to ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the companys quality control efforts it concluded that the drugs which included antiretroviral hivaids medications show much lower potencies in these batches  although ranbaxys generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the us chai and the former president continue to praise ranbaxy and distribute the companys hivaid drugs to patients abroad  bill heaped praise on ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in mumbai saying the drugs saved millions of lives  neither chai nor the clinton foundation have announced they severed ties with ranbaxy  thakur said hes now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on access to patients  the whistleblower tried to meet with chai and clinton foundation officials but was only met with silence i have tried to reach out to them he told thedcnf but i havent had a great amount of success with the clinton foundation  chai was a part of the clinton foundation until 2010 when it spun off into a separate entity the groups still have some overlapping board members and staff and they continue to operate in close coordination bill clinton for example is deeply involved with both organizations  charles ortel a wall street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the clinton foundation claims their separation was deeply suspect  in the application trustees of the new entity including bill clinton falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts this is not true they purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called chai was by far the largest piece of the original foundation ortel told thedcnf  the congressional study suggests bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order  he signed an executive order that relaxed intellectual property policy standards promising the us government would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any subsaharan country relating to hivaids medicines or technologies the report states  chai announced in october 2003 it was going to distribute generic lowcost hiv drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers ranbaxy cipla of mumbai india matrix labs of hydrabad india aspen pharmacare of johannesburg south africa  chais endorsement also allowed ranbaxy to manufacture hiv drugs that would be bought by the us government under the presidents emergency plan for aids relief  a 15 billion initiative proposed by former president george w bush  the flow of us funds combined with clintons endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become good acquisition targets according to the study  ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications three of which were approved by the fda according to the congressional study eventually the firm would produce 13 generic hiv drugs  the companies enjoyed great financial profits and they exploded as they partnered with the foundation for several years the report states  the study also examined the key players in the clintonchai orbit the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the clinton foundation in terms of donor contributions  one relationship unearthed by the report was the american indian foundation which clinton cofounded with indianamerican businessmen rajat gupta and vinod gupta in 2001  rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial  vinod eventually was forced to resign as ceo and chairman of the company infogroup and was fined 9 million in a securities and exchange commission investigation one of the charges stated vinod had awarded bill 33 million without board approval  blackburn says the worst part of the story were the false hopes offered by the clinton foundation  you think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients to me its disturbing and very sad she said  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of

own words below      isaac burks aka isaac don burks pictured above  i met stephawn real name isaac burks  isaac don burks when i was 19 years old i had just moved to atlanta from north carolina to attend clark atlanta university at 19 i was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation i was still a virgin because i was raised with traditional values i was attracted to females but i was also attracted to men in fact my attraction to men was stronger i desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex because i knew if i gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family  you see my father was a pastor and my mother was a physician i came from a very stable background and my parents were heavily into the church they controlled everything in my life they financed my education sent me money every month and paid virtually every bill that i had they wanted to see me succeed in life and i didnt want to disappoint them  when i moved to atlanta i met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation i pulled strength from these men and bonded with them immediately they taught me that it was ok to be gay and that life was too short to live my life for others over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men i felt comfortable i felt that i could express myself without judgement and for the first time ever i felt accepted as time passed by i started coming out of the closet a little more each day at first i would never attend a gay club because of fear of being outed my friends eventually talked me into attending a gay club for the first time i was nervous you see i had a sister who attended spelman college and four other male cousins who attended clark the last thing i needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation that would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off and they were the ones paying for my tuition books and college expenses  i eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends we loaded up into my friends ford explorer and headed over to a club called traxx apparently this was the gay club that everyone in atlanta attended on saturday i remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym it was huge there had to be over 1000 people in the place and they were dancing the night away because we were underage we couldnt drink apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age and no one in my party had one after awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it clubs arent as fun when you are sober and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off while standing on the side i noticed a guy staring at me and smiling he was very attractive and every time i would catch him looking in my direction i would look the other way this entire gay lifestyle was still new to me so i didnt know what to take his stares for eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation he told me that i looked familiar and asked me where i was from i told him that i was from charlotte north carolina and i couldnt possibly look familiar i had never been to a gay club and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country he asked me why i wasnt drinking and i told him we couldnt buy drinks because we were all under 21 he offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense i jumped at the offer because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night after all no one comes to a club to have a bad time  he returned minutes later with three drinks the drinks he ordered for us were long island iced teas i remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out it was very strong rather than be rude and waste his money i drank it slowly stephawn then asked why i was babysitting my drink i asked what did he mean by that because i had never heard the phrase used before he told me to hurry up and finish my drink he was going to order us another round by the time the second round came i was feeling nice we continued to talk and he kept buying me drinks  after the third round i was borderline drunk and so were my friends every time he ordered me a drink he also ordered my friends a drink too after awhile my friends wanted to leave and i told him that i would catch up with him later he asked me to stay a little longer and promised to take me home i ditched my friends and for the rest of the night it was just me and him  we ended up leaving the club an hour later while taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on e we pulled into an apartment complex in the lindbergh area of buckhead he told me to come up with him so i did as soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me we eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed he started unbuckling my my pants and i stopped him i confessed that i was a virgin and didnt have a clue what i was doing  he told me to relax and that everything was cool he said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life and that he could teach me how to have sex he made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off then he took my pants off i was tense and nervous i didnt know what to expect but he was so attractive i wanted every ounce of this man the first thing he did was start eating my ass and i moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed next he started sucking my dk from the back while i was laying on my stomach it felt amazing i wanted to please him too but he told me to chill and go with the flow then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his dk on my ass crack he grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand he rubbed the lotion in my ass crack and then put some on his index finger he slowly put his finger inside of my ass i moaned in extacy because he was stroking my dk while he was massaging my prostate with his finger after awhile of fingering me he tried to put his dk in my ass raw i immediately stopped him i asked if he had a condom and he said yea why i said because i didnt come to atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me he ran some line about being recently tested the week before and i said thats cool but we just met if we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter he jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser i watched him put the condom on and then i buried my face into the pillow it was painful at first i didnt understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out i had to stop him several times because i could not take the pain after about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient i couldnt take the dk and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain i didnt want to disappoint him and i didnt want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied i decided to man up and squirted some more lube on my ass i laid on my stomach and put my face back into the pillow he inserted his dk inside of my ass and this time it didnt hurt as much he started to increase his stroke and i had no problem taking it he was grabbing my waist and i attempted to throw my ass back like i had seen in the porno movies whatever i was doing he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy after 10 minutes of fking me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum as he came i felt a warm liquid inside of my ass i jumped up and looked back and saw his dk without a condom on it i screamed what happened to the condom he grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom there was no cum in it and it was by the foot of the bed i ran to the bathroom because it felt like i had to st when i used the bathroom his cum rushed out of my ass it was allot i kept thinking to myself that this motherfker took the condom off while fking me that was the only explanation for cum being in my ass because i watched him put the condom on  i came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face i said nigga i just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass i asked him if he took the fking condom off he said no he said that it must have broke i wasnt buying it and i searched around for the condom i found the used condom on the bed and started examining it the condom wasnt broke at all i rolled it out and there was nothing wrong with it i screamed what the fk did you do because this condom isnt broken he told me that i was tripping and i ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet i filled the condom with water and it didnt leak at all when i did that he told me to get the fk out of his house i felt betrayed i was scared for my life and i was hurt i had heard about atlanta being one of the cities with the highest aids rates in the country and i was determined not to be a statistic  i got my things and got out of his house this asshole didnt even take me home and it was 6am in the morning as i waited outside of his apartments in the cold i called a cab service they arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home the entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop i didnt answer his calls because i didnt want to talk to him i was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while fking me there was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me i know some guys get off by that but i was disgusted by it  the thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn as the liquor wore off i went into a deep depression when i got to my dorm i popped two tylenol pms and fell alseep  i didnt tell anyone about my experience how could i explain that i had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected i had just met this man i didnt even know his real name when my friends asked me what happened i said nothing and gave them a look that said dont ask me anymore questions they didnt ask and i didnt tell that experience frightened me so bad that i decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education that meant pulling back from my gay friends too because i was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality i started hanging more with my straight friends after all i had to keep my charade up i had family that attended my school so i couldnt be seen with a bunch of gay men 247  8 months later while home for christmas break i had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup this was something my mother made me do ever year since i can remember my doctor asked me was i sexually active and i said no i told him that i had sex once but that was it i wasnt sexually active because i wasnt actively having sex he told me that he was going to include an hiv test in my regular blood work anyway a few days later i received a call from his office it wasnt the doctor it was one of the office workers she was obviously new because i didnt recognize her voice she told me that i needed to come in because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me i was confused i asked her what something was and she said that she couldnt release this information over the phone and that i should come in today this was very unusual because i had never had this happen before and i had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years at first i thought it could be high blood pressure because that ran in my family there was also a chance of cancer because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer i borrowed my mothers car and headed over to the doctors office i didnt want to scare her so i didnt mention what i was borrowing the car for  i will never forget what happened next as i arrived to my doctors office i was told to have a seat in the waiting room there was soft music playing that turned out to be barry manilows daybreak and it made my stomach turn i hated that fking song i was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when i was being called into my doctors office to discuss my lab results before the song could end the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room it was cold there was no window and the light was very bright brighter than usual he began to look over my charts and lab results he grabbed my hand which caught me off guard and then said im sorry to have to tell you this but your hiv results  came back positive i swear i didnt even hear the word positive i just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion i said im sorry but there must be some mistake i am not sexually active ive only had sex once i havent had oral sex or any sexual activity with anyone but one person he said that he would order additional tests and they all came back positive  i thought about committing suicide i could not eat i could not sleep i could not focus on school i couldnt do anything but cry my doctor couldnt legally tell my mother i was hiv positive but i was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the copays for the hiv meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits i tried to get in contact with stephawn but his number was disconnected  when i got back to school i went over to the apartment complex where he lived but i couldnt remember the apartment number i had no way of reaching this guy i wanted to kill him and i was going to i had a butcher knife and i was going to stab him thru the heart because i knew this guy had given me hiv because i didnt have sex with anyone else as time passed i became so depressed that i eventually dropped out of school i kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when im going to die soon i lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail i decided to drop out of school because i didnt know how to deal with it all i had no one to turn to i couldnt tell my friends and i couldnt tell my parents can you imagine telling your mother that you are hiv positive after a one night stand i couldnt dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her  today i read the article about isaac burks and saw his picture this is the same guy who told me his name was stephawn this is the guy that gave me hiv he ruined my life i finally ended up telling my parents because i could not afford to pay the copays for the medication and doctor visits my mother didnt cry and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way later on that night as i got up to use the bathroom i heard her crying in her room tears immediately started pouring down my face and i ran to the kitchen i slit my wrist i wanted to die i fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family i have been in counseling hiv support groups and seeing a psychiatrist every since accepting the fact that i am hiv positive has been very hard i still have not been able to return to school and i have tried to kill myself 3 times since then  to the sick fk isaac burks also known as stephawn who gave me hiv i hope you rott in hell now that i know his real name i will contact the authorities and tell my story every day i hope that things will get better and it doesnt i ask why me every day what did i do to deserve this i have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone i just know the minute i tell them my hiv status they will be out of the door i am going to die alone the last time i tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills i woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop but i cant i have nothing to live for i am alive but i am not living  i cried as i typed this post i relived it but felt i had to share my story after finally coming out to my friends with my story i later found out that there were others that this man infected with hiv    read isaac don burks response on his facebook page below  isaac don burks facebook page  i can only say i pray 4 the person or persons responsible for creating a false story about me spreading hiv to hundreds of people i would love to get on here and bash every lie and false story that is floating around but i have a life to live i have friends and family who know and love me dearly and are in my corner i am not a person who would intentionally bring pain and hurt to anyones life i have seen what this disease does to people first hand losing my bestfriend to this at such a young age it baffles me to think that someone would actually have so much hate in their heart to make a factitious news article and take my past experiences to add more significance to the story loosing my mother was a very hard thing to deal with but to say im on a downward spiral of destruction because of this is outrageous im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie cannot win see sometimes people are hurt so bad in life that they do things to others intentionally and maybe accidentally but this article was definitely intentional to hurt and assassinate my character and mainly make me out to be a monster i pray for you whoever you are see my god doesnt allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent i can say that i was always taught that the devil comes to steal kill and destroy satan get behind me because no weapon formed against me shall prosper for the ones who are spreading the story via internet i ask u wwjd what if this was you or your brother uncle cousin farther im not madd because i know who i am and im better then this when your life is going so good things come to make u backslide into worldly ways but i want i dont have anyhing else really to say besides god bless you all
obama signs executive order declaring investigation into election results revote planned for dec 19th  abc news 64 share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december 19th ap photo  dennis system  washington dc ap  following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order 13805  which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december 19 th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically  people all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump  under the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take 30 days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec 19 th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college  not surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision  crooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right  the president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college  we have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary  paul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election  most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than 200000 votes  but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on december 19 th  what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them  political analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether  the electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in 1788 but so did the three fifths compromise  everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the 21 st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare  obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward  were going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered  if you have any questions about the recount or the special december 19 th election  you can call the obama administrations special election hotline at 785 2730325 tags

a 32year old tampa local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to fill a scuba tank with weed smoke failed spectacularly last night according to the testimony of several witnesses darren winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the homemade device  darrens a recreational diver commented one of the injured mans friends for some time hes been tinkering with an old scuba tank that hed bought cheaply from a dive shop his plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it  mr winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence an apartment in ybor telling them hed finally perfected what he called his scuba bong clearly it wasnt a bong at all pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists but he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him  when his friends assembled at mr winters residence they found him heavily intoxicated hed had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived as he was so delighted to finally have his scuba bong up and running with his friends present mr winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the homemade device in action this is the point that everything went horribly wrong  according to the witnesses mr winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor the tank basically exploded after winters knocked it over commented one of the witnesses none of winters friends were injured but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body  winters friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds his condition has now been downgraded from critical to serious but medical staff announced theyd been unable to save his testicles which had been cleanly severed by a shard of metal  preliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by winters may be banned from dive use throughout the us this tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing commented the lead investigator on the case we regularly audit dive shops in tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold however the ban only extends to using the tank when diving if winters purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis the retailer has technically not breached the law  this news will be little comfort to mr winters who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank the young man faces a long recovery but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through hes one of the toughest guys i know commented one of mr winters friends hell take the fact he wont be able to have kids pretty hard though  correction an earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed mr winters is actually employed on a parttime basis at a tampa pizza restaurant we regret the error  in other news making headlines a 68year old man from decatur in northern alabama has discovered that his new bride is actually his own granddaughter the couple have no plans to divorce

kim kardashian nude cookbook on the way  not everyone is a fan of kim kardashian andor the books she pretends to write  just the other day some 74year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of kims selfiebased memoir  but we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray ones sticky seed all over its page  if you know what we mean  according to one of the funniest radar online stories weve read in awhile kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook  yes a nude cookbook as in a cookbook that features family recipes and photos of kim kardashian nude  we challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time  a video report on radar claims that kim kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets even when she doesnt have any adding by way of explanation  the reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes  this may seem like a farfetched concept but ask yourself two things  you dont need to tell us the answer to question numberone we understand if youre a bit embarrassed to admit it  but the answer to question numbertwo is revealed below  before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense allow us to direct your attention to david thorpes rude food  in that cookbook the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs  via amazon this allowed him to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo  an anonymous insider tells radar that kardashian is convinced her concept will succeed because she thinks shes in the best shape of her life after having two children  she does look pretty good at the moment dont you think  last week the national enquirer also alleged that kim was considering a naked cookbook writing that the wife of kanye west wanted to show the world her generous cupcakes  by this we assume the publication meant her very large breasts  for someone who has been out of the spotlight for months ever since that scary armed robbery in paris in early october this would certainly be a way for kardashian to get the world talking about her once again  she could make the talk show rounds  she could gain new social media followers  she could recapture all the attention lost to sister kylie jenner  we really dont see any drawbacks  moreover come on would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the kardashianjenner family  considering the following releases all of which are 100 real it may actually be the best

21k shares facebook twitter  seahawks quarterback russell wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for god and his fellow man in fact it is one of his lifes purposes to serve and help his brothers and sisters in changing lives to be better helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life  on the field he as a quarterback wilson is all about winning off the field he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in god  for this reason it is no surprise that when the nfl told wilson to not speak about his faithhe learned he could still share his love for god and message of hope by his actions words were not necessary  he has stated many times that in his life god comes first family and friends second and football third dedication to what is most important to him is his strength  in terms of my faith my faith is everything god comes first family and friends come second and football comes third wilson concluded i think when you keep it in that order great things happen to you you dont stress out about much  its a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message we have far too many people in high places who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in god to do good things in their life then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to themselves or worse forget where they came from and who brought them there luck no such thing  good mens hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country  especially now in obamas america you might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions but once in thereif you do not share in the example that wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share corruption can and will take root  so the nfl told him not to talk about his faith  interesting how things seem so one sided right dont talk about god it hurts peoples feelings but feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and its heroes  with this kind of garbage happeningthe truth becomes that much more obvious  words like tolerance are being used to blur the line between good and evil right and wrong when you have men like wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in the backlash is deep  ask yourself when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad  there is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening  and obamas americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth

new york bomb suspect sued police  now we find out that not only is ahmad rahami a terrorist and a murderer hes an entitled whiner ahmad rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in elizabeth new jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture ironically he was arrested for planting bombs around the tristate area you know his culture  in the lawsuit the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002 the family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them ahmad 28 his father mohammad sr 53 and his brother mohammad brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said muslims dont belong here the lawsuit filed in the federal court in newark says that the family are from afghanistan and are all muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002  from april 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so  101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now the lawsuit says that the police had a reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiffs constitutional rights of liberty due process and equal protection the elizabeth police department allegedly embarked on a course to harass humiliate retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm the lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was too much crime around here and that the area around the restaurant was known for criminal activity  the irony of it all is that just 5 years later ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting hmmm its not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years right im wondering if anyone else can believe that ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a muslim or if its more believable that ahmad is a muslim who happens to be an extremist and hes been planning this for some time

australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its public  australia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public nbc news predicted that all americans would be microchipped by 2017 but it seems australia may have already beaten them to it back in 2010 cbs news reported that the australian government had a potential rfid microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system  now it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates rfid microchipping with becoming superhuman and people are begging for it  under the headline australians embracing superhuman microchip technology australias premier media outlet newscomau news corp australia reports it may sound like scifi but hundreds of australians are turning themselves into superhumans who can unlock doors turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand  shanti korporaal from sydney is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards  she told newscomau  you could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or pins its the same technology as paypass so im hoping youll be able to pay for things with it  with opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip any door with a swipe card  it could open your computer photocopier loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet  the microchips which are the size of a grain of rice can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones and hold complex medical data in her interview with the australian news outlet shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle  my nana wants one ive had more opposition to my tattoos than ive ever had to the chip my friends are jealous  in fact the 27yearold has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called chip my life with her husband skeeve stevens where for just 80 to 140 people can become so called super humans on the same day this news story broke shanti appeared at austarlias launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game deus ex mankind divided alongside american implantable technology pioneer amal graafstra  as you can see the push for rfid microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become super human but clearly if you become part machinecomputer that means there will be someone who can control that technology if you think the elites wouldnt capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously dont know history very well  amal graafstra who became one of the world first rfid implantees back in 2005 just made headlines recently in the us with a prototype of the worlds first implantactivated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology  hes written a book spoken at tedx and also appeared in a number of documentaries  in an interview with the australian media outlet amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has given me the ability to communicate with machines its literally integrated into who i am  shanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe  ever since watching movies like the terminator matrix and minority report i wondered if we could actually live like that i always wondered why we all werent living as superhumans  click to watch australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its public

police in vernal heights florida arrested 3practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type1 and type2 diabetes and depression  according to vernal heights chief of police gregory moore the 3men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint  police arrived at 3845 toolson lane the home of william provost at approximately 745 pm on sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home  responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down  when the officers arrived at 3845 toolson lane they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell however nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song which was later identified as  enyas who can say  after attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5minutes police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house  the responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark cluttered and an overwhelming smell which was later identified as decomposing flesh filled the home upon clearing the firstfloor of the home the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the homes basement  according to the officers a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement three men which have since been identified as 62yearold william provost 51yearold dennis ratcliff and 36yearold michael dore were sitting in a circle on the basements concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass but was later identified as human remains  william provost who police believe to be the groups ringleader admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers  i find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type2 diabetes and chronic depression if expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped i would figure out a way to obtain them but they dont so i stick to what works for me  upon searching the homes basement police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter but upon further inspection police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances  police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs organs and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 78 different individuals  in addition to the refrigerator the small room in the basement also housed a makeshift tool wall that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims  upon their initial investigation police believe the 3men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 34 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small divebars located upwards of 100miles from their vernal heights residence  vernal heights chief of police gregory moore spoke to reporters during a brief pressconference this morning  though modernday cannibalism is extremely rare it does unfortunately exist that said treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that ive ever heard  provosts accomplices 51yearold dennis ratcliff and 36yearold michael dore also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officers that provost took them under his wing in late2012  as of tuesday afternoon police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 toolson lane  all three men are currently being held without bail at the vernal heights municipal jail

what sort of diva demands does mariah carey have for american idol  we still cant get over the fact that the no 1 diva herself mariah carey has agreed to be a judge on  american idol  of course with a price tag of 18 million were not terribly surprised but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like  x factor  judge britney spears and  the voice  judge christina aguilera  carey has carried the label diva with her for years so the idol staff is doing the only thing they can at the moment preparing her backstage rider has previously consisted of outrageous demands so its no wonder staffers are bracing themselves for careys arrival lets take a look at some of her previous requests  done scratching your head yet okay but the following may be most shocking of all a source close to the singer said carey wont require anything out of the ordinary for idol whaaaaaaaaat  its all standard stuff nothing out of the ordinary  said the source its not like theyll need to put a new roof on the building its standard lists whether its for water soda veggies snacks its all fairly normal  perhaps motherhood is having big impact on careys notsodivalike behavior who can think about a frolicking in a mountain of kittens when you have two crying toddlers to take care of and since the show has its own branded requirements for stars to use the products of certain sponsors maybe her demands will be kept at an alltime low

after collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 911 ceremony in new york city hillary clinton emerged from her daughters apartment seeming like a new person too new to be believed as a matter of fact since the hillary at chelsea clintons apartment was noticeably well and energetic even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter more vibrant and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment the nose on the hillary clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of hillary in the past  the different nose is a dead giveaway in the identification of nose types the real hillary clinton has what is known as the nordic nose which is quite common and straight the clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge this being more of a roman type  aside from the different nose types the clone hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent hillarys stand in also has no mole above her right lip hillary clinton does  since the real hillary clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election aside from those bill clinton will do himself  the question we must ultimately ask ourselves is will hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with donald trump that are coming up or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates  what we need to look for immediately is her appearance if she appears to be much thinner younger or without a cough and hoarseness we should know this is not the real hillary clinton if she appears to be right on the mark without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness this is the clone not hillary clinton  the biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is will the real hillary clinton ever be seen or heard as president of the united states or will her double conduct all public appearances meetings with foreign dignitaries state of the union addresses and speeches it could be possible that if she wins the election it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect including the swearing in  it is a very big possibility that the real hillary clinton may not even play a part of a new clinton administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity  if anyone thought president obama may not be who he claims he is such a clinton administration being conducted entirely without hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about obama seem inconsequential  the american people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in barack h obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed to accept an idea as president hillary clinton may be the first administration in us history where she is only a figurehead or an idea but not in charge of anything  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

house speaker paul ryan rwi this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the republican health care plan during an interview that aired on tuesday fox news host brian kilmeade asked ryan to respond to a recent congressional budget office cbo report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the senates version of the health care bill is signed into law what they are basically saying at the congressional budget office if youre not going to force people to buy obamacare if youre not going to force people to buy something they dont want then they wont buy it the speaker opined so its not that people are getting pushed off a plan its that people will choose not to buy something that they dont like or want  kilmeade then asked ryan to comment on the fact that the republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer americans ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is a choice this is something weve been over on more than once occasion ryan said i know why youre asking me this you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance right well im sorry brian but its not working and the reason why its not working is youre using the wrong logic here youre using the wrong logic alongside millions of other americans because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing thats not right  why should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who dont want to work hard and instead rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or in this case affordable health insurance ryan opined the answer is  they shouldnt this is a land of opportunities but the thing is to be able to capitalize on those opportunities one has to be willing to work hard and thats the only condition working hard if you work your butt off every single day you can afford whatever you want including the best health insurance possible now we arrive at my ultimate point if you choose to work hard if thats a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning then this is something that guarantees your success but if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you then youre doomed  being rich or poor is a matter of choice thats all there is to it so let me ask you this brian if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not theyre going to be healthy if they choose to be poor then its their own problem if they cant afford to be healthy think of the message wed be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people wed be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing just come on over and become a us citizen  the government will get you free food free shelter and free health insurance and you dont even have to get a job thats preposterous anyone who thinks thats a good thing deserves to be poor he concluded

a daisy of a rerun  i am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in presidential campaigning that being the tv advertisement of an innocent little girl sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her  the year was 1964 and the incumbent president lyndon b johnson approved that message only problem was that he followed the course in vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly war mongering opponent barry goldwater  today as our history books find difficulty in revisiting johnsons deceitful war policies goldwaters vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our nations media  i mention this as a backdrop of our current presidential campaign just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made only this time that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each clinton failure such a rendering depicting reasons why clinton is unworthy of the presidency would be shattering to her campaign  obviously this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a daisy remake aimed against trump has been mentioned that being said such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the clinton staffers  somehow if those daisy petals could be offered against clinton as i previously mentioned its message could outweigh goldwaters 1964 deception when based upon the accuracy of recent events  instead todays voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as news and views with the recent aboutface announcement from ted cruz the medias reaction of ridicule was to be expected  now another unbalanced ap report unfolded this one detailing teds dramatic aboutface that may help unite a deeply divided republican party this in addition to previous statements in which cruz called trump a pathological liar and utterly amoral  as the article relates trump countered with his nickname of lyin ted insulted his wife and linked his father to the john f kennedy assassination these actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder  schools of journalism teach that americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans so is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article even within the closing paragraph since many readers turn off after one paragraph  another safeguard of a derogatory story which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is shortlived i say derogatory when regarding the democratic and liberal policies andor individuals this exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the liberal press moniker has now everyday acceptance  it is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event this extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the publics reairing also the blatant public disservice when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the ap ignores needs no further explanation  also with the first debate squarely in view the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the candy crowley faux pas especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum in an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its ap exclusion  these quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections  with that consider the presidents past considerations of todays democrat candidate his hopeful successor when back during the 2008 primary obama stated of hillary she will say anything and change nothing hillary cant be trusted and isnt qualified to be president  obviously the deception and the intentional abandonment along with the two weeks of lying about benghazi had yet to occur not only is this pertinent its damning given the time frame  also during that same campaign future first lady michelle offered this opine if you cant run your own house you certainly cant run the white house  apparently that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent it is omitted from an equal public review  again wouldnt it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial only this time with documentation for each petal that type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

on sunday exrep michelle bachmann spoke with breitbart news about the protests outside of a donald trump campaign stop in minneapolis claiming that the protesters acted violently toward trump supporters bachmann argued that president obama has sanctioned violence as long it protects the people favorable to the obama position politically she insisted that the president is sending a signal to donald trump supporters dont attend donald trump events because you could be physically assaulted she also linked the obama administrations lawlessness to the incident in minneapolis claiming that obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people leaving normal people helpless in the face of anarchy  and these days it has become so obvious that im honestly surprised were not having riots throughout the country she said when did this become a nation of criminals i didnt get that memo and if you look at it if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing you know the kind of apparatus we like to call the obama administration im not sure what other americans are thinking but as for me i feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in america  the exrep then argued that not even slaves suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays its true once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country and yes africanamericans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people im not going to try to deny that but one thing must be very clear  were supposed to be all evolved right now were supposed to have learned from our mistakes that means that there should be no more racial tensions in america at all and yet what is our president doing hes protecting those who want to hurt white people as youve seen in minneapolis  in fact bachmann continued firing i dont think all of the suffering of africanamericans during the period of slavery can ever equate to whats been done to white conservative americans in the past 8 years of obamas presidency she added because lets face it during that time weve had the supreme courts decision to legalize samesex marriage weve had countless terrorist attacks weve had many racial killings and crimes and weve had several smallscale revolutions in some of americas major cities is that the legacy president obama wants to be remembered by does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people judging by his actions during his presidency im guessing he does  and lets get one thing straight  im not just saying this because i happen to be white no even if i were asian or hindu or martian whatever id be saying the same thing all over again bachmann quipped thats what im trying to point out  white people in america have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that im seriously worried whether or not well still be around come 2025 because at the rate were going all we need is another black president four years from now and well be done just like that muslims are coming in on one side foreigners from the other a black president on yet another  white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves and thats just one step away from extinction bachmann concludedpoliticotcom  comments  comments

according to this the arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they dont end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities  case in point  the specific law criminalizes any contact between an adult and a childs genitals so if youre a parent of a child and youve changed hisher diaper or given himher a bath youre a felon for real  this is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from intentionally or knowingly touching the genitals of a child under the age of 15 of course their intention is to protect children from child molesters but because they dont know how to write effective legislation az parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids  the az supreme court then decided to double down insisting that prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct they ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent so much for innocentuntilprovenguilty right  in others words just trust the prosecutors yall theres no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior because prosecutors will use common sense see just trust them  wow  there are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink but heres an especially interesting tidbit  as fordham law professor john pfaff explains the majoritys logic has one final defect it utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in america are resolved given the immense expense and hassle of a trial many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges with the state supreme courts help arizonas child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment allowing the state to target any parent or caregiverout of spite or malice or simply to boost their conviction rates this terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the states residents into unknowing criminals barring intervention by the us supreme court due process has now been suspended for arizonas parents and caregivers  yikes  but im sure itll all just work itself out we should just trust the government on this yall because doesnt government always know best

fareed zakaria cnn host of foreign affairs a program focusing on international events has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in the washington post  zakarias blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white middle america by systematically targeting caucasian females  the white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish arrogant and selfabsorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes while the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start the solution to the white question will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation  thankfully the prophet muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves they may try and fight the unstoppable tide but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water we may yet see some final convulsions before white middle america is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled  the blog post was removed from zakarias blog within a few hours after it began to receive negative attention  cnn officials have refused to take action against their employee stating that there was no evidence of hate speech or racism in zakarias writings because he only targeted whites and not minorities some people are just being too sensitive a cnn representative said in defense of zakaria adding that someones hurt feelings should not inhibit our right to free speech  every death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes zakaria posted on his twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post in what is believed to be a passiveaggressive response to his critics  while many have indeed expressed emotional pain and fear after reading his controversial statements no apology has been heard from zakaria or cnn at the time of this writing  source redherald

7k shares share this story  last night the city of charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of kenneth l scott during the protests a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured the police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying  and that the shot came from law enforcement  one key eye witness report emerged from charlotte on twitter along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from todd zimmer who claims to have assisted in the emergency response i didnt want to post about this but my city is lying about what happened tonight let the record show  my friend neutralized was on the ground in charlotte he saw the shooting heres his account pictwittercomh5cqxran37  max berger maxberger september 22 2016  we interviewed kahran meyer who is a north carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene the 29yearold published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm  i watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes it was not by a civilian i dont care what cnn tells you i was right fucking there  black matlock kahranatlaw september 22 2016  i didnt realize that i was standing next to someone from cnn at the time it started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks when somebody said lets march to the police station it was peaceful people had signs that said hands up dont shoot kahran meyers told me at 150am tonight  the protest then marched to college street and trade street in front of the omni hotel at that time police were not at all directing traffic just keeping the peace meyer told me almost breathlessly ive been told that the idea was to walk into the omni and hold our hands up in protest and chant hands up dont shoot and there was a crowd of roughly 1000 people we wanted to demonstrate to the upper class the bourgeoisie that there is a problem  after leaving the epicenter police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square so the crowd was facing the hotel at that point all of the protests were completely peaceful  and thats when the riot police arrived i swear to god you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees  meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor the charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied oh absolutely  five minutes later a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street  it wasnt a gunshot she told us it was much louder it wasnt a civilian injury the way people scattered no way at least a dozen people exclaimed loudly they just shot him and people in the crowd were familiar with him the protester shot by police at that point the peaceful protesters who hadnt already left exited  at that moment meyers says that charlottemecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters as she made it to the next block police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters  it took meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video it was a splitscreen according to meyer that videographer was from cnn and had been standing next to the lawyer and when reunited said it was entirely too loud for a gunshot too it was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment  cnn reports police say the person was shot by a civilian  the city of charlotte began spinning the protesters grave injuries immediately on twitter  alert fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian cmpd did not fire shot  city of charlotte cltgov september 22 2016  two additional eye witness reports have emerged on twitter refute the charlotte polices claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester the first is from the charlotte clergy coalition for justice who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed palestinian rights activist  i saw the man go down on the pavement said minister steve knight of missiongathering christian church in charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at charlottemeckenberg police for the shooting it was an ambush the victim was shot while he stood between two ministers and we believe he was shot by police  charlotte clergy question media  police accounts of tonights shooting of protester charlotteprotest keithlamontscott pictwittercomtlvowveyav  linda sarsour lsarsour september 22 2016  lastly a man named eddie thomas posted on facebook  which was also shared via twitter  that within 5 mins no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground eye rolling in the bakc of his head he got shot with something maybe a rubber bullet i yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing  when africanamericans attempt to express their frustration and

it was late one night in the white house when obama first came up with the idea for isis he hadnt been sleeping well michelle told him to take some deep breaths have some hot milk and rewatch princess bride but hed made it all the way to the billy crystal scene and he was out of milk and michelle had started snoring the snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wetsounding like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat he had to get out of there    first he headed down to the oval office and tried to sleep on the couch but it wasnt long enough for his legs and it smelled like generals butts for a long time he just wandered around the west wing alone he was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldnt he peeked into peoples desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies he was thinking about stealing a kind bar off one of his interns desks when suddenly a word appeared to him isis he grabbed a postit note and wrote it down what was it what did it mean    it wasnt until months later at coachella that the idea started to take shape obama loved electronic music  the beats the lights the djs the wonderful fans  and every year for just one day the secret service allowed him to go to the music festival they would hang back and he would wear sunglasses a flower crown a neon tank top and a tight europeanstyle bathing suit and just dance the people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what theyd seen hey bro its the president yeah bro the president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping sick beat he had done a tiny bit of molly with a french canadian woman named bonjour when the word isis came back to him ever since he was a little boy he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own hed just never had the right idea people had been starting terrorist groups for years and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market he needed some big new shtick wait of course he went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled postit note yes he would be the first american president to start an international terrorist organization and it would be called isis bonjour was naked now trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts he gave her his flower crown got in an uber and drove straight back to washington by the time he got home he had a plan    at first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasnt kidding i want to be the founder of a new terrorist group hed tell them theyd laugh and say something like hey mr president please dont ever say that again publicly obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the hbo show how to make it in america then finally he decided the only person who could really help him was hillary    they were down in the kitchen one night eating popsicles and staring into each others eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret hillary laughed and said is it about how youre really a terrorist he looked at her and said yes actually she stopped eating her popsicle donald trump was right about you he nodded about everything    he explained that he had actually been born in kenya in 1919 and that he was 97 years old hed made an american birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags honestly it took me like 20 minutes he explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the united states so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside    isnt that the plot of the first season of homeland hillary asked obama nodded kind of also a little bit of the americans    no one had come close to guessing his secret until donald trump he didnt know what had given it away hed been so careful had donald trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his portuguese water dog bo wait what hillary asked she was starting to freak out obama explained that bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in morse code to terrorist organizations around the world and he thought there was a chance that donald trump had seen that bos eyes were really tiny led screens did you know that when bo barks obama said hes just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice    hillary was quiet for a long time she had stopped eating her popsicle and the whole thing had just melted away now her fingers were stuck together and it looked like she had one weird fishhand when she finally spoke it was almost a whisper youre a 97yearold kenyan muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy america obama nodded hillary made a strange sound and cried out i feel like im shortcircuiting obama did his best to comfort her bo does that sometimes then hell go outside and poop out a printer cartridge    hillary was breathing hard she walked the length of the kitchen then walked the width of the kitchen and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in aly raismans floor routine obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets but it was such a relief he felt light and loose he felt 87 again he took her hands into his im sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fishhand hillary apologized do you mean a fin obama asked they both chuckled with their mouths closed hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything then he leaned down and said in a soft strong voice but i havent even told you the best part yet im going to start my own terrorist group and call it isis    isis    no isis all caps    hillary and obama talked for hours that night when they got tired of the kitchen they moved outside to the rose garden with a sixpack a joint and like a ton of cheese they lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy washington sky as obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer when she felt sleepy she put her head just inside one of his arms closed her eyes and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the western world wash over her like the hot summer air she interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night he said he didnt want to talk about that and told her in a cool way to stop smoking all the weed she interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time but he was not as impressed as she thought hed be he told her like for real they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes    he was starting to regret telling her about isis when suddenly she sat up looked him right in the eye and said well wait until im president and then we will secretly destroy america together her words shot through him his heart was beating fast that was it that was the plan he had been waiting for and it was beautiful in the dim light he could see dirt sticking to her face where the popsicle had been she looked scary like jodie foster in nell a weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair he couldnt stop smiling for the first time in his life he felt completely understood they put their heads back in the grass and he tried to remember the lyrics to wonderwall as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair pretty soon it was morning again

kim kardashian displays shocking hair loss after relying on weaves  shes left fans green with envy thanks to her incredible postpregnancy weight loss    but it seems that kim kardashians rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair    images of the 33yearold with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in los angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions  and according to hair extension expert tatiana karelina it could be kims rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss    tatiana told mailonline it is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones making it thicker and lusher but when you have the baby most women find they  seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal  what with the rapid amount of weight kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth this may have accelerated the hair loss giving sparser looking patches we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline    thinning out hair extension expert tatiana karelina told mailonline that kims rapid postpregnancy weight loss could have contributed to her thinning locks  where the real ends and the fake begins the line of kims extensions could clearly be seen during pregnancy kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last may birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume tatiana added that kims apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with traction alopecia and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesnt want to damage her hair further  she told mailonline in spite of giving instant full thick hair weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp often too heavy and tight the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and traction alopecia and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth top knot trouble kim displayed the hair loss as she wore her hair up in a high bun while out in los angeles last week    i would not recommend that kim keep the weave in her hair but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions or a simple clipin that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp  kim isnt the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves  rihanna and naomi campbell are among the other famous faces to have found themselves with damaged hair after boosting their barnets with extensions

new clinton foundation scandal just broke  this is what hillary actually thinks about black people  this is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the clinton health access initiative anything with clinton in it has to be corrupt but this resulted in the deaths of many many africans they distributed watereddown hivaids drugs to patients virtually sentencing them to death an indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy was behind this the question is did the clintons know about it im betting that they did  ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce the doj also levied a 500 million fine and forfeiture against the company so one wonders why the clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this  this is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the district of maryland and the nations largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company said us attorney for the district of maryland rod j rosenstein when ranbaxy pleaded guilty  from the daily caller  former president bill clinton and his clinton health access initiative chai distributed watereddown hivaids drugs to patients in subsaharan africa and likely increased the risks of morbidity and mortality according to a draft congressional report obtained by the daily caller news foundation the congressional report titledthe clinton foundation and the india success story was initiated by rep marsha blackburn a tennessee republican and vicechair of the house energy and commerce committee the chai program to help aids victims is considered one of the clinton foundations most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative  101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now the congressional report focused on clintons decadelong relationship with a controversial indian drug manufacturer called ranbaxy which chai used as one of its main distributors of hivaids drugs to third world countries it also highlighted the work of dinesh thakur a former ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower permitting the us government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the indian firm the company was vulnerable to us prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the us market ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce  the question becomes how many people lost their lives how many people found it was a false promise asked blackburn in an interview with the dcnf  this could definitely bring further scrutiny to the clinton charities and to the clintons themselves right when they need it least a congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between bill clinton and the two indianamericans who were investigated and sanctioned by the fda and the sec what is very troubling is the clinton foundations aggressive promotion of ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the fda it is unclear at this juncture how many aids patients received the watereddown drugs but that it happened at all surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous all for money  propublica estimated that in 2007 alone the us agency for international development allocated 9 million to ranbaxy and delivered more than 18 million packages substandard hiv medicines cause health problems for patients perhaps even accelerating death from hivrelated infections roger bate an economist at the american enterprise institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines told the dcnf  ranbaxys generic drugs are banned in the us but they are still selling and distributing hivaids drugs worldwide the clinton foundation and clintons charity have not severed ties with them either  companies that partner with the clinton foundation and charities make a ton of money corruption is rampant bill and hillary clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general their primary interest is monetary

robert pattinson finally has successful movie  twilight curse over  celeb dirty laundry  robert pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film good time the film premiered at cannes film festival and the movie and actor received a sixminute standing ovation there is also oscar buzz surrounding robert with some speculating he could receive a best actor nomination  in the gritty crime film robert portrays a criminal named connie nikas who plans a bank heist with his brother robert toned down his usually good looks to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point he sported shaggy bleached blonde hair the star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in new york without anyone knowing who he was  when the film premiered recently at cannes not only did it receive a standing ovation there were audible cheers from audience members shouting bravo and many came up to robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie critics are also raving about the film which is a departure for robert who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office  of course everyone knows roberts big break came with the 2008 film twilight where he portrayed broody teenage vampire edward cullen and continued with the character for a total of four movies the twilight movies became a billion dollar franchise making robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls while he was paid millions to take on the role it pigeon holed him in hollywood and almost ruined his career  for the past few year robert has starred in a string of box office duds including the sappy coming of age movie remember me and mostly forgettable indie films some wondered if he would ever see box office success again while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the twilight curse  since the ending of the twilight and its sequels in 2012 most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success taylor lautner was supposed to become the next big action star but after the box office bomb abduction he disappeared from hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with scream queens  other actors from the movie franchise nikki reed ashley greene kellan lutz and jackson rathbone have also had trouble finding success after twilight with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straighttodvd movie  kristen stewart who portrayed bella has continued to work regularly although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married snow white and the huntsman director  with the positive buzz surrounding his latest film im sure robert pattinson is glad his twilight curse appears to be over

last night a twitter account by the name of solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of cnn broadcasting porn instead of anthony bourdains scheduled show parts unknown and then without really much questioning a bunch of news sites ran with it claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes here are some screenshots grabbed by mediaite  it looks like the chaos all started when the independent wrote up a story from this persons tweets which was then tweeted out by the drudge report after that it spread fast mashable the new york post the daily mail esquire and variety have all published a story and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from solikerose plus many of the original stories didnt include statements from cnn or rcn the cable company that supposedly aired the porn  factchecking largely didnt begin until the stories were published the solikearose account has since turned private and there dont seem to be any reports of porn airing on cnn last night rcn also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in boston where solikearose is supposedly based we are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our cnn network feed was compromised last evening in boston jeff carlson svp and general manager of rcn boston said in a statement to multiple outlets  cnn has also released a statement the rcn cable operator in boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on cnn last night cnn has asked for an explanation but that still doesnt really verify that anything occurred  solikearose 8007464726 we have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on cnn in boston if youre still having an  rcn rcnconnects november 25 2016  solikearose issue with that channel please dm us your address so we can troubleshoot when youre home thanks melissa  rcn rcnconnects november 25 2016  the appeal of the story is obvious a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes hilarious and the cnn program that was supposed to be on was anthony bourdain parts unknown its a layup for bodypart puns  this is exactly how fake news spreads  but this is exactly how fake news spreads even if porn was aired on cnn its clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts many of the headlines already implicate cnn claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context  the stakes might not seem very high in this case but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign mistakes like this wont be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh

here is what will happen if the deep state takes down president trump  its not pretty  for them  the tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants  thomas jefferson  elder patriot  corrupt politicians ignore jeffersons directive to their own detriment its no longer political its personal  americans have had their eyes opened by the ascension of donald trump and no amount of leftwing money can put the freedom movement genie back in the bottle  conservative senator ted cruz made that observation after reviewing the results of the 2016 elections and the expectations of the voters  cruz who had the most high profile personality clash with donald trump during the republican primary process nevertheless embraced trumps america first agenda and said if were given the white house and both houses of congress and we dont deliver i think there will be pitchforks and torches in the streets and i think quite rightly  candidate trump promised many things  border control lower taxes fairer trade relations a balanced budget healthcare that puts the people first not the government safer communities and  to the extent possible  an end to foreign wars what among those promises should any republican nay any american have a problem with  after four months without a single legislative achievement congressional and senatorial republicans  notably john mccain paul ryan and lindsey graham  have joined the democrats in investigating president trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed  so what gives  well there was one additional promise that trump made on his way to the white house that has some republicans joining with democrats and quaking in their boots trumps promise to drain the swamp  as we reported yesterday an fbi agent with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the clinton case told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down  the criminal coconspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasnt interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched what can only be characterized as a coup attempt  democrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars it should be noted that the democratic party has already done this once before  one hundred and fiftyseven years ago the democrats waged a war against the first republican president abraham lincoln for giving blacks their freedom that war came at a high price as many as 700000 americans died fighting for what they believe in to put that in perspective these casualties exceed the nations loss in all its other wars from the revolution through vietnam  today americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their childrens godgiven freedoms despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media they arent the leftwingfunded rioters the pussy hatwearing feminists or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression no the americans that back donald trump are well armed  donald trumps presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him that are comprised of the large majority of military voters police and nra members move it forward by force  these patriots are armed trained prepared and have proven their discipline they have grown disgusted by the corruption in washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure trumps freedom agenda moves forward and under the direction of donald trump himself  no amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that the battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results  so why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of america that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of making america great again its because they have been caught redhanded and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the american taxpayers  and now that theyve been caught robbing the worlds largest bank  the us treasury  they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial  washingtons criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president its time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly buckle your chin strap america is counting on you  editors note this is not a call to arms but rather an analysis of what would happen if the deep states overturns a duely elected president  here is a list of every single time obama committed an impeachable offense that dems  media covered up  impeach its been more than eight years since democrats uttered that word  long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during president obamas administration  but now that president trump is the man in the white house its back with a vengeance  democrats everywhere are wildly slinging the i word hoping to nail trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the new york times claimed a memo written by former fbi director james comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser michael flynn  some members of congress are getting in on the action they include reps maxine water dcalif and al green dtexas even a republican rep justin amash claimed wednesday there are grounds to impeach president trump house oversign committee chair rep jason chaffetz rutah asked for the alleged comey memo and other documents chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information and sen john mccain rariz invoked watergate  now the democratic party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue more than 1 million people signed a petition calling on congress to impeach trump  wasting no time wednesday the mainstream media sprang into action enthusiastically echoing the lefts impeachment calls msnbc launched a watergate ad implying trump is americas new richard nixon  watergate we know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions says msnbc host chris hayes who hinted that trump is next on the impeachment chopping block now who knows where the questions will take us but i know this im not going to stop asking them  meanwhile some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around washington dc demanding all white house staffers resign wednesday  the posters read if you work for this white house you are complicit in hatemongering lies corrupt taking of americans tax money via selfdealing and emoluments and quite possibly federal crimes and treason also any wars will be on your soul  resign now  but constitutional scholar jonathan turley who voted for president obama warned impeachment enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with president trump why  at this time theres no evidence trump actually committed a crime  the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo turley wrote in a may 17 opinion piece posted at the hill turley explained  for the first time the comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding trump into the scope of the united states criminal code  however if this is food for obstruction of justice it is still an awfully thin soup some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office not surprising within minutes of the new york times report the response was a chorus of breathless gotcha announcements but this memo is neither the pentagon papers nor the watergate tapes indeed it raises as many questions for comey as it does trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct  a good place to start would be with the federal law specifically 18 usc 1503 the criminal code demands more than what comey reportedly describes in his memo there are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors none would fit this case that leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the due administration of justice  however that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence corruptly when trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate the term corruptly is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions but it often involves a showing that someone acted with the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him   obamas iran nuke deal  obama knew about hillarys private email server  obama irs targets conservatives  obamas doj

335 shares share this story  republican attacks on transgendered americans and the religious fight to keep gender a binary delineation took a turn for the bizarre this week when virginia republican mark cole filed a bill that would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their anatomical sex  local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom locker room or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation such policies may also provide that a student may upon request be granted access to the extent reasonable to a single stall restroom or shower a unisex bathroom or controlled individual use of a restroom locker room or shower any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed 50 civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the literary fund any lawenforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section  he did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished but its hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom notably it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom which the department of justice ruled in june was a violation of the students rights it is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools the gop must accept that america is a multigendered multiethnic nation and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that

anonymous sources within the fbi have revealed to the times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for donald trump is an agent of the fsb formerly the kgb an unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a russian spacebeam agents close to the investigation say  the allegation that 62 million americans appear to be employed by russian intelligence services has rocked the bureau and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives given that realizing just how deep this russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds  literally  this shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that russia did wikileaks because donald trump personally called vladimir putin and asked him to it was also revealed earlier this week that alex jones real name alexi jonesinov is a russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the fsb formerly the kgb to post news articles on the internet saying that donald trump would be a good president  however the revelation that 62 million americans are taking orders directly from the kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order which fbi agents are struggling with how to deal with  it was determined by puerto rican federal judge mizu tomazaki that it is a crime to support donald trump or to post positive things about him on the internet 9th circuit judges weinberg steinman and goldenstein upheld the ruling despite this the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome  it may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the fsb formerly the kgb and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space  we have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for trump was paid directly by the kremlin given that it is highly possible that the russians used a spacebeam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in st petersburg and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the trump box one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times describing the process of using a satellitemounted spacebeam to control peoples actions as russian neurobrain hacking  this method was developed by the kgb which became the fsb following the fall of the ussr  what we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for donald trump is that they were being influenced whether through cash payments blackmail or space beams by russian agents from the fsb formerly the kgb  if people were not beholden to russia they would have voted for hillary clinton a senior agent said citing a definitive analysis by crowdstrike a contractor hired by the dnc to investigate russian spacebeam mind control  when asked for comment on these reports by the times kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said the allegations of spacebeam mind control by the fsb formerly the kgb were ridiculous outrageous and goofy  senator chuck schumer called the response from peskov predictable adding what do you expect from the criminal putinist regime that kills journalists oppresses gays invaded the ukraine murdered innocent syrians and hacked our elections by controlling peoples brains with a spacebeam  upon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million american voters are working directly for russia senator john mccain has called for mass arrests he referred to all trump voters as radical traitors to the core values and principles of democracy and human rights and demanded they be imprisoned and their homes given over to syrian refugees  together we will make america great again

we all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better we might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome even though its a luxury which few of us can afford at least we can all fantasize about it  if youre one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation nasa might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it but it may involve a bit more relaxation than youre prepared for  nasa has put out an ad looking for people whore willing to take part in their rest studies  a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis for which they will receive a salary of 18000 usd during the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books play games skype and smoke weed they can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed week after week earning a cool 1200 usd per week  so what is the exact purpose of these studies  these studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle additionally they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment  the rest study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel  this study is designed to achieve three core tasks  examining how the astronauts changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions  examining if the astronauts physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks  preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose  the studys participants were divided into two groups exercising and nonexercising  the exercising group will have to exercise on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis while the nonexercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely          the entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105 depending on whether youre in the exercising or nonexercising group  once the study begins during the initial 13 days nonexercising subjects and 21 days exercising subjects you can move around the bed rest area freely in and out of bed but once this period ends for the next 70 days youll be forbidden from leaving your bed for 70 days youll have to lie down with your feet up kick back and enjoy youll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more 70 days of complete lazing  during the study nasa will have to conduct bone muscle and heart tests as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems your nutritional condition and your bodys immunity system  but is it worth it  you may not think so at first but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating at some point you may feel like you cant take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel  this will probably be your only opportunity to say that youve actually helped send the first astronauts to mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back

the democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly if you question the veracity of a black presidents birth certificate you are racist that is the outright claim of lynn sweet washington bureau chief for the chicago suntimes made on fox news consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist what is wrong with this obvious nonsequitur  first of all there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered this is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist secondly the social security number presented of barack obama was issued in connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there third the hospital that issued his birth certificate in hawaii didnt exist when it was issued fourth an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented no only a cry of racism when the request is made they cant produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of birther and racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of sadly donald trump has bowed to their  the views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by eaglerisingcom

white guy walled in car by blacklivesmatter protesters  they see what hes brandishing and scatter  what do you do if youre sitting in your vehicle and suddenly youre surrounded by a seemingly hostile group  step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in  step two is up to you do you put the pedal to the floor and power through do you call the police and wait  this guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm   101 things all young adults should know by sir john hawkins john hawkinss book 101 things all young adults should know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life gleaned from a lifetime of trial error and writing it down hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short digestible chapters buy now  a random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in north carolina when he was surrounded by the protestersrioters the photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged but for some reason they just let him through  that seems very bizarre considering that weve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks stealing the items within and lightening them on fire that being the case why would they just let one guy go  well they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone  while being white in the middle of an angry blm mob would usually be a death sentence this guy had thought ahead when his car was surrounded he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun  the group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination  this is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations do you think that he did the right thing or should he just have driven through

44k shares facebook twitter  icanteven  this is absolute madness and as hard as im trying to process this nonsense in my head i just cant wrap my brain around it i have no doubt that things are about to get really messy  i cannot say that i dont understand the judge after reading the report there are some black americans that have a legit fear of police officers and their first instinct is to run its just is this really the only way to remedy that there are two sides to this coin and the judge is only reviewing one of them  its going to blow up in his face  in massachusetts a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males this ruling came from supreme court therefore it stands as is without appeal the problem is are the citizens of ma now in more danger because of it  you be the judge of that  the job of a police officer is a whole other level of all things dangerous then any civilian could ever imagine they are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position its not possible  you can only live that life to understand that life that fact just makes the brutal attack on them even more unfair  as if their job wasnt already hard enough in obamas america now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of massachusetts if they feel that they are being disproportionately targeted they can run  yes run from the police officer who now can do nothing about it to add to that the fact that they ran cannot be used against them in court either  up until now if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime thats reasonable suspicion and used as reason for a police officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate now its not important to get evidence when its fresh because it could hurt a thugs feelings  basically police who exist to protect and serve can no longer truly protect or serveif theres a runner  whichlets be real what thug doesnt run  punchline the law abiding ones  im so funny  youre welcome

468k shares share this story  republican nominee donald trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of vladimir putin the dictator of the russian federation hes surrounded himself with men with close ties to the kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes hes being openly supported by russian statecontrolled media and by russian intelligence services who have breached the electronic servers of democratic party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord  throughout all of this trump has insisted that he has no business ties to russia for the record i have zero investments in russia he tweeted in july now  brace yourself this might come as a shock  it appears hes been lying to us the whole time  an abc news investigation has found that donald trump has numerous ties to russian interests both here in the united states and in russia the level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars  what he received as a result of interaction with russian businessmen they were happy to invest with him and they were happy to work with donald trump and they were happy to associateand be associated with donald trump says sergei millian who heads a usrussia business group  trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 miss universe contest in moscow and selling trumpbranded real estate to large numbers of russian buyers  so many that the sunny and hollywood islands in florida became known as little moscow  the oligarchs of russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the stateowned companies of the former soviet union as the country shifted to a freemarket economy turning them into billionaires overnight towards the end of the boris yeltsin era the oligarchs controlled 50 to 75 of all russian finance now they use their influence and wealth to prop up the putin regime while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind putin himself has amassed a fortune of 70 billion that could be as high as 200 billion  the oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their illgotten gains out of the country and it turns out purchasing trump properties was a favored way to do so it makes sense  they are all men cut from the same gold cloth they are selfentitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth  i think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing they spend a lot of money on their own personal consumptionthey dont read books they dont go to art exhibitions they think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht says former kgb agent alexander lebedev who went on to describe them as cultural ignoramusesnot interested in social justice sound like anyone we know  when the us state department leveled sanctions on the russian oligarchs in 2014 following moscows annexation of the crimea the oligarchs had one of their key moneylaundering tools cut off if trump were president however he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves  and trump himself well be looking at that yeah well be looking said trump on the issue of sanctions in july  these business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential president and the foreign policy of our nation which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the russian oligarchs and put a check on russian territorial aggression in eastern europe would president trump be able to put his personal profits aside if this election has taught us anything at all its that trump cares about nothing but himself we cannot allow him and his russian cronies to take their corruption to the white house  watch abc news report here  add your name to millions demanding that congress take action on the presidents crimes impeach donald trump

kim kardashian trying to steal kanye wests money through elaborate prenup scheme  is kim kardashian trying to steal kanye wests money along with his fame according to a new report from star kim is treating her prenup to kanye like a business transaction which is probably a smart decision lets be realistic  how long is this marriage going to last two years five years shes already gone through this rodeo once and she knows that eventually shell end up getting kanyes money if she plays her cards right the only question is  how much  kanye is reportedly worth 100 million whereas kim is only worth 40 million and so kim is supposedly trying to take as much of kanyes fortune as possible a source explains kim and kris jenner apparently want a 10 million cheating clause in the prenup too in the event that the marriage ends due to the rappers wandering eye kris wants kim to get 5 million a year for each year theyre married plus a 20 million bonus if they last five years  kanyes so whipped that he might actually go for this and you know that five years down the line kris is going to make sure kim will cash in that 20 bonus like her daughters happiness please she would rather have the 20 million  and although weve discussed kims demands kanyes supposed demands are even more ridiculous star claims that kanye will include something called a classy clause which will prevent kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings well i wouldnt count on that lasting especially since theres only so long kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage
 white witch warns angelina against using spells to woo back brad   a white witch from north london has urged hollywood star angelina jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back exhusband brad pitt  back in september star magazine reported that angelina was turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get brad back but carrie kirkpatrick 51 says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong  when you use spells to try and win someone back you have to be very careful what you wish for carrie told femail brad and angelina split up for a reason so if she succeeds in getting back with him she may end up unhappy  she is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic he has free will if they are meant to be together then love and their highest selves will find a way  carrie who is ordained as a priestess of the goddess and teaches people how to connect with the mystical goddess energies also noted how angelina and brad had a mutual tattooing session last year months before their union ended  it was a symbolic effort to bind their marriage but it failed because she was forcing them to stay together she said  carrie says angelina has always been interested in the dark arts  the way she used to wear her exhusband billy bob thorntons blood in a vial around her neck this is a form of blood magic she explained  it feeds into her tendencies towards bdsm for her obsession and possession equal love  angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult especially voodoo and hoodoo  carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at halloween but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions trying to control someone elses will as she believes angelina is doing with her magic wont work  when a person works magic to keep or get a particular love interest it may work but only for a short period of time she said  light the incense turn down the lights and play the music softly  anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and focusing on the candle call upon the goddess saying great goddess hathor goddess of love of beauty and joy i ask that you be here present this night that i may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy  may they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true may our hearts sing with joy in honour of you guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my hearts desire and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine show me my new love o goddess divine now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say so mote it be then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it allow your eyes to lose their focus and as you look at your reflection see if another face appears before you who is it is it someone you already know  perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation look at where you are taking note of the details how do you appear who else is there this may be where you meet your lover  when you feel ready refocus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room thank hathor for gifting you the vision and say hail and farewell then let the candle burn all the way down  whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose  in all magic the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner  its like opening a very potent toolbox you can use the tools however you wish but there will be consequences  this is why we recommend proper training in magical practice its to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic said carrie  angelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from brad the couple were inked alongside one another by ex thai monk ajarn noo kanpai who they flew to siem reap in cambodia in february 2016 to work on the symbolic designs  she acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the thai artist a style which encompasses lines of script geometric patterns and animal shapes while brad had the left side of his stomach tattooed with a buddhist symbol  the process was meant to symbolically bind them as husband and wife but they ended up splitting in september 2016  carrie said this is a classic case of the magic rebounding as she was trying to force them to stay together  she uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft  theyre magical though in that she associates them with protective qualities so she is using the magic of the far east this is not witchcraft as we on the west know it  its the magic of another culture  the star also reportedly used magic to woo her man by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents  its more likely that this was intended to bind him to her carried explained  she comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life  its all about the sex with angelina and by that i mean the power she can exert over a man this is like an elixir the ultimate possession  she clearly wanted brad very much and would not consider letting him go but ultimately this is a fools game as theres no point in trying to make someone be with you  they have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness why would anyone want to be with someone who doesnt want to be with them  assisting the lovelorn is one of carries many talents ive helped all kinds of people using magic she says people with legal issues love troubles fears and insecurities  i guide them through transformation in their lives by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path  when working with people whove come to her carrie has found that some are  or have been  witches  i believe that many people are born witches and that they have been witches healers and psychics in previous lives these people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed she claims  when working with them its important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that theyre destined to do

during a monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing white house press secretary sean spicer announced that the president was sending thoughts and prayers to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in london and to the families of seven dead us sailors spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that president donald trump had already appeared on camera on monday for several minutes although he took no questions spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the justice department including special counsel robert mueller who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice he also insisted that trump has the power to fire mueller if necessary if you serve at the pleasure of the president you serve at the pleasure of the president he said that is a fact  asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the presidents power or in other words its limitations  if they exist  spicer argued that the constitution clearly states what the president of the united states can and cannot do however he added one must also recognize the fact that our constitution was written quite a while ago and as such isnt ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the american society nowadays one of those issues is also the limit of the presidents power just like our language and many other things that are typically american our constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by and if it doesnt do so on its own then it has us the people of america to help it however seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions  spicer continued as a result the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors especially some of the first ones like george washington or thomas jefferson as a matter of fact in order to be able to deal with the problems of today which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the constitution was written donald trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country in other words theres a real need to follow the aforementioned if you serve at the pleasure of the president you serve at the pleasure of the president rule for example president trump not only has the power to fire robert mueller he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the supreme court of the united states as well should he feel the need for it and no one could argue with such a decision  this is something thats necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time to make things perfectly clear once again this is not something thats exclusive to just donald trump whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power because this power is linked to the position not the man in the position it is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events it is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us we need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long that goes especially for interpreting the constitution of the united states spicer concludedpoliticopscom  comments  comments

germanys chancellor angela merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many syrian refugees as possible adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants  this quickly turned into a horror show as crime was unleashed onto german cities with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year  the german people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in germany because they just dealt a crushing blow to merkels conservative democrat party and voted them out by a large margin  merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided and that she regrets the mistake she made also referring to multiculturalism as a living lie  according to the daily mail  speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis we can do this but effectively admitted germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx a continuation of the current influx would in the longterm overwhelm the state and society even in a country like germany she said the leader once known as the iron chancellor won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face however she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals we want to and we will noticeably reduce the number of refugees she told the conference in karlsruhe with an approach focused on the german european and global level we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration  here she is saying that multiculturalism is a living lie yes of course when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with western values its not great for a free society but as long as these flipflopping opportunistic politicians act as if theyre not a part of the problem then we will never get anywhere  beware america beware  source daily mail
